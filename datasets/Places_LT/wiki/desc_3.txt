In architecture, an alcove is a small recessed section of a room or an arched opening (as in a wall).
The section is partially enclosed by such vertical elements as walls, pillars and balustrades.


== Etymology ==
The word alcove originates from Arabic: القبة, al-, 'the', and qubbah, 'vault' (through the Spanish, alcoba).
