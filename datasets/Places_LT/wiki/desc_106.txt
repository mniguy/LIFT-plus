A hallway or corridor is a room used to connect other rooms.
In 1597 John Thorpe is the first recorded architect to replace multiple connected rooms with rooms along a corridor each accessed by a separate door.

Hallways are generally long and narrow. Hallways must be sufficiently wide to ensure buildings can be evacuated during a fire, and to allow people in wheelchairs to navigate them. The minimum width of a hallway is governed by building codes.  Minimum widths in residences are 36 inches (910 mm) in the United States.  Hallways are  wider in higher-traffic settings, such as schools and hospitals.
