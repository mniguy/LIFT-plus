== Description ==
Hipparchia statilinus has a wingspan of 60–68 millimetres (2.4–2.7 in).  These butterflies are rather variable, especially in the shades of brown present on the wings and in the intensity of the white bands. Usually the basic color of the upperside of the wings is dull brown in the male, lighter or ocher in the female, with a fringe on the edges. Two blind or very discreetly pupillated black eyespots are present on the forewings, while the hindwings show a very small eyespot.
The underside is marbled with ocher and dusty white bands. On the underside of each forewing there are two black eyespots ringed in yellow, the upper one with a white central spot. Between the two black eyespots there are two white spots. On the underside of the hindwings there may be a black spot near the posterior and anal margin. The caterpillars are greenish-beige with green-brownish longitudinal stripes.
