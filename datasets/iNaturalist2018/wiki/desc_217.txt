Lema daturaphila, commonly known as the three-lined potato beetle, is a species of beetle in the family Chrysomelidae.


== Description ==
Adult L. daturaphila measure 7-8 mmm in length and a bright orange-yellow in colour. Their elytra are marked with dark brown lines, one at either side and one along the suture between the wings - it is from this feature that their common name derives.


== Diet and behaviour ==
Three-lined potato beetles are found on plants in the family Solanaceae and are often agricultural pests to crops. They are uncommonly found on potato and rare on tomatoes, but very common on tomatillo (Physalis ixocarpa). The larvae hatch in late June or July and feed on their host plant and are often found in groups. The larvae cover themselves with their own excrement, probably as a natural defence against predation.
