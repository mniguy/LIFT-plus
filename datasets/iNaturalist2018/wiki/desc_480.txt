== Subspecies ==
Corizus hyoscyami hyoscyami (Linnaeus, 1758)
Corizus hyoscyami nigridorsum (Puton, 1874)


== Distribution ==
Corizus hyoscyami subs. hyoscyami is found in most of Europe; in Britain, the species appears to be spreading northwards, having been recorded in Yorkshire. Corizus hyoscyami subs. nigridorsum is present in Spain, Italy, Morocco and Tunisia.


== Description ==
Adults of Corizus hyoscyami are about 9 millimetres (0.35 in) long. Like all scentless plant bugs, it lacks well-developed scent glands and can be distinguished by numerous veins in the membrane of the hemelytra, characteristic of all members of the Rhopalidae.
In Corizus hyoscyami subs. hyoscyami the third and fourth abdominal tergites are red, while in Corizus hyoscyami subs. nigridorsum they are completely black. The dorsum colours are visible in elitrale transparency under the membrane.
Although striking in colour, Corizus hyoscyami may be confused with the similarly marked but unrelated  Pyrrhocoris apterus (firebug) (see comparison).
