Lophomyrtus obcordata, also known as rōhutu or tutuhi, is a species of evergreen myrtle shrub in the genus Lophomyrtus, family Myrtaceae. It is found throughout New Zealand, usually in lowland forest and forest edges.Lophomyrtus obcordata grows to a height of 8 metres (26 ft), producing many branches closely packed together. The leaves are 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) wide by 5–10 mm long, with a very distinctive notch at the end making them heart shaped, There are oil glands on the underside of the leaves.
Lophomyrtus obcordata has white flowers in summer. The berries range in colour from red to dark red to black, are 4–8 mm (0.16–0.31 in) in diameter, and ripen in summer to autumn.Lophomyrtus obcordata will easily hybridise with L. bullata (ramarama), the only other species in the genus. This has given rise to a number of cultivars with interesting foliage variations that are sold commercially.Propagation is usually by semi-hardwood cutting, or by seed.The wood is red coloured, very dense and hard, and has been used for small dimension inlay work.
