== Subspecies ==
Four subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
Tropidoclonion lineatum annectens Ramsey, 1953 – central lined snake
Tropidoclonion lineatum lineatum (Hallowell, 1856) – northern lined snake
Tropidoclonion lineatum mertensi H.M. Smith, 1965 – Mertens' lined snake
Tropidoclonion lineatum texanum Ramsey, 1953 – Texas lined snakeNota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Tropidoclonion.


== Etymology ==
The subspecific name, mertensi, is in honor of German herpetologist Robert Mertens.


== Geographic range ==
The lined snake is found throughout the central United States from Illinois to Texas. 


== Habitat ==
The preferred habitat of T. lineatum is grassland areas with soft, moist soils.


== Description ==
The lined snake is olive green to brown with a distinctive tan or yellow stripe running down the middle of the back from head to tail. It has similar stripes, one down each side on scale rows 2 and 3. On the belly, it has a double row of clean-cut black half-moon spots running down the middle. It has a narrow head and small eyes.
Adult size is typically less than 35 cm (14 inches) in total length (including tail). However, maximum recorded total length is 53 cm (21 in).The keeled dorsal scales are arranged in 19 rows at midbody. There are only 5 or 6 upper labials.


== Behavior ==
The lined snake is semifossorial, spending most of its time hiding under rocks, leaf litter, logs, or buried in the soil. 


== Diet ==
The majority of the diet of T. lineatum consists of earthworms.


== Reproduction ==
The lined snake is ovoviviparous, the young being born in August.  The average brood is seven or eight. The newborn juveniles are 10–12 cm (4-4¾ in.) long at birth.
