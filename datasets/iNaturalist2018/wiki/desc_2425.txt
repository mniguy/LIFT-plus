The striped red mullet or surmullet (Mullus surmuletus) is a species of goatfish found in the Mediterranean Sea, eastern North Atlantic Ocean, and the Black Sea.  They can be found in water as shallow as 5 metres (16 ft) or as deep as 409 metres (1,342 ft) depending upon the portion of their range that they are in.  This species can reach a length of 40 centimetres (16 in) SL though most are only around 25 centimetres (9.8 in).  The greatest recorded weight for this species is 1 kilogram (2.2 lb).  This is a commercially important species and is also sought after as a game fish.Mullus barbatus and it are commonly called "red mullets" and often are not distinguished, though they can be told apart by the striped first dorsal fin of M. surmuletus.
Despite its English name, the striped red mullet, of the goatfish family Mullidae, is only very distantly related to the grey mullet and other species called "mullet", classified in a different family of the order Perciformes.
