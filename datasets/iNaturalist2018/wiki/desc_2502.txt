It has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution. It is found in the aquarium trade.

== Description ==

This species shows marked sexual dimorphism:
Female: Length up to 7 cm (2.75 in), orange/gold color with violet streak below the eye
Male: Length up to 15 cm (5.9 in), fuchsia color with elongated third ray of the dorsal fin, a red patch on the pectoral fin, and elongated margins of the tailThe midas blenny, Ecsenius midas, goes through a phase of yellow colouration and is a social mimic of the sea goldie.The sea goldie feeds primarily on zooplankton.  Like other anthias, the sea goldie is a protogynous hermaphrodite; a male retains a harem of five to 10 females, but when the male dies, one of the females will undergo sex reversal and take the place of the missing male. Spawning occurs at sunset, between December and February (in the Red Sea).


== Habitat ==
The fish lives around coral outcrops in clear lagoons, patch reefs, and steep slopes to a depth of 35 m, often found in the company of Chromis dimidiata. They are often found in very large schools above the reef.
