Antirrhinum nuttallianum (syn. Sairocarpus nuttallianus), and known by the common names Nuttall's snapdragon and violet snapdragon, is a species of New World snapdragon.
It is native to southern California and Baja California, where it can be found from the immediate coastline to the inland coastal ranges.


== Description ==
Antirrhinum nuttallianum is an annual or biennial herb producing an erect, vinelike stem which sometimes clings to objects for support, but does not twine as tightly as many other snapdragons.
The flowers are veined light purple with white patches and around a centimeter long. Each is borne on a short pedicel.
