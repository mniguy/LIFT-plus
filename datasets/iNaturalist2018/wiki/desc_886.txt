It is found in North America from Nova Scotia south to Maryland and west to Kansas and Alberta.The wingspan is 30–40 mm. The wings are white to pale brown or grayish. The antemedial, postmedial and terminal lines are composed of black dots. Adults are on wing from late August to early October in one generation per year.
