Armadillidium nasatum is a large, Western European-based species of woodlouse that has been introduced to North America, along with Armadillidium vulgare also found in other parts of Europe.


== Description ==

Armadillidium nasatum can reach lengths of up to 21 millimetres. Though similar in outwards appearance to Armadillidium vulgare in dark grey color, the main distinguishing feature is pale longitudinal stripes spanning from head to rear and rectangular-like protrusion towards the apex of the head. Like Armadillidium depressum, it does not form a complete ball when enrolled. The tail has a rounded tip with incurved sides, as opposed to most genus Armadillidium species which have a flat tail.


== Distribution ==
Armadillidium nasatum occurs in patches in southern England, with concentrated areas in its range and sporadic occurrences in Ireland. It lives in dryer areas than most woodlice, is synanthropic, and is frequently found in non-inhabited areas such as railway lines and industrial waste ground. Like other woodlice, it is found under stones and wood.
