The green-barred woodpecker (Colaptes melanochloros) is a species of bird in the family Picidae.  The scientific name melanochloros derives from the Greek melanos, meaning "black", and chloros, meaning "pale green", the principal colors of this bird. The golden-breasted woodpecker is sometimes included here as the southern subspecies group of this species and is sometimes considered a separate species, C. melanolaimus.
C. melanochloros (including the golden-breasted woodpecker) is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.
