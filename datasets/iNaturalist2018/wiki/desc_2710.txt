Hynobius quelpaertensis, the Jeju salamander, also spelled Cheju salamander, is a species of salamander found on various islands and peninsulas off the southwestern coast of the Korean Peninsula, including Jindo, Geojedo, Jejudo, and Namhae. It inhabits moist mountain forests.
Jeju salamanders are speckled brown in color. Adult males are 8–14 cm (3–6 in) in length, and adult females 7–11 cm (3–4 in). Males are also distinguished by their thick front legs and black coloration on their backs. This species mates from March to late April, laying eggs under small rocks and leaves in mountain pools.
The Jeju salamander was previously considered a subspecies of the Korean salamander, and was classified as Hynobius leechii quelpaertensis.
