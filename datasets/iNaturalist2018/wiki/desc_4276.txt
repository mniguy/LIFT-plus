Diploderma swinhonis, also known commonly as the Taiwan japalure, Swinhoe's japalure, Swinhoe's lizard, and Swinhoe's tree lizard (Chinese: 斯文豪氏攀木蜥蜴), is a species of lizard in the family Agamidae. The species is native to Taiwan.


== Etymology ==
Both the specific name, swinhonis, and some of the common names are in honour of English naturalist Robert Swinhoe.


== Geographic range ==
D. swinhonis is native to Taiwan, where it is found on the islands of Taiwan, Orchid Island, Green Island, and Xiaoliuqiu. The species has been found in Japan, possibly carried there by humans.


== Behaviour and habitat ==
D. swinhonis is arboreal and lives on trees and on the ground at altitudes below 1,500 m (4,900 ft). The primary diet consists of ants, cockroaches, and other small insects. The males perform a push-up display with relatively fixed pattern when approached by competitors and predators.


== Description ==
The total length (including tail) of D. swinhonis reaches 31 cm (12 in). The body is 8 cm (3.1 in) long. The back is brown. The dewlap is black with white spots and intensifies when aroused. Diploderma swinhonis is sexually dimorphic. Males have a brighter color than females, have a yellow stripe on each side of the body and are larger. The inside of the mouth is greyish-white or black.


== Diet ==
D. swinhonis feeds on insects and small invertebrates.
