Desmognathus is a genus of lungless salamanders in the family Plethodontidae known as dusky salamanders. They range from Texas to the eastern United States and to south-eastern Canada.


== Characteristics ==
Species of the genus Desmognathus have a unique jaw-opening mechanism where the lower jaw is stationary and the skull swings open. There are additional stalked condyles, an atlanto-mandibular ligament, along with other skeletal and musculature features that have evolved to accompany this type of jaw-opening mechanism. Additionally, they are known to exhibit maternal care by brooding over their eggs. 


== Species ==
This genus includes the following 24 species:
The AmphibiaWeb does not recognize Desmognathus aureatus and Desmognathus melanius, (originally described as subspecies of Desmognathus marmoratus) and hence only lists 21 species.
