It is sometimes called dark green bulsedge, black bulrush, or green bulrush.It was first formally named by Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1809.Scirpus atrovirens grows in a wide variety of wetland habitats, typically in sunny areas rather than shady. It can be found in wet meadows and shrubby thickets, openings in swamps, marshes, shorelines, as well as roadside ditches. The plant can grow up to five feet tall, and thrives in hardiness zones 3-9.It is closely related to Scirpus hattorianus and Scirpus georgianus, with mature fruits necessary for accurate identification.
