Pholiota aurivella is a species of fungus in the family Strophariaceae that is found in native forest of New Zealand, southern Canada, and in the United States. It is frequently found in the American West and Southwest, especially in late summer and fall. Most field guides list it as inedible, with one reporting that it contains toxins which cause gastric upset. It is sticky or slimy when moist and grows in clusters on live or dead trees.
