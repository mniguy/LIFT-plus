Strymon bazochii, the lantana scrub-hairstreak or smaller lantana butterfly, is a butterfly in the family Lycaenidae. It is found from Paraguay north through Central America, the West Indies and Mexico to southern Texas. It was introduced to Hawaii in 1902 to control Lantana species, in which it has proven unsuccessful.

The wingspan is 22–25 mm. Adults are on wing from May to December. There are two to three generations per year.
The larvae feed on Lippia alba and Lippia graveolens in Texas. In Hawaii, they feed on Lantana species and basils. Adults feed on nectar from various flowers, including  Bidens alba, Lantana species and Stachytarpheta jamaicensis.
