Dittrichia graveolens, commonly known as stinkwort or stinking fleabane, is a plant species in the sunflower family, native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia as far east as Pakistan. It has become naturalized in California, Asia, Africa, Australia, and other places and is regarded as a noxious weed in some regions. It is a classified as an invasive species in California, and a potential threat to wine production in the state.Dittrichia graveolens is a branching subshrub up to 130 cm (52 inches) tall, with a rank, foul smell. Leaves are long and narrow, pointed at each end, with small teeth along the edges and glandular hairs on the surfaces. One plant can produce numerous yellow flower heads with as many as 16 ray florets and 40 disc florets.Dittrichia graveolens can kill grazing animals. Barbs on the fluffy-tipped seeds, which help it spread, damage the animals' digestive systems. Oils in the plant also taint the flavor of meat and milk of animals that have consumed the plants. It has also been known to cause allergic reactions and severe dermatitis in people who come in contact with the sticky resin.  So, when pulling this plant out, be sure to wear gloves.
