Scent-scales of the male short, broad, irregular, produced in a number of filaments. The female is in 2 forms:  female f. philolaus Boisd. similar to the male, the underside paler, female f. niger Eimer (nigrescens Eimer; felicis Fruhst.) the pale green bands of the membrane of the wings scaled with black, the wings therefore black with slight traces of the bands."
