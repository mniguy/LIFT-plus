Psyllobora vigintiduopunctata (often abbreviated to Psyllobora 22-punctata), the 22-spot ladybird, (earlier known as Thea vigintiduopunctata) is a common, 3–5 mm long ladybird native to Europe . The elytra are yellow in colour with 22 black spots. The pronotum is yellow or white with 5 black spots. This ladybird species has been reported in other areas of the province of Kerman, Mazandaran, South eastern province of Khorasan, Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari, in Mashhad, Gilan, Lorestan province, Khorasan. Unlike most other ladybirds which feed on aphids, P. 22-punctata eats mildew — especially from umbellifers and low-growing shrubs . The 22-spot ladybird is best looked for amongst low vegetation.
