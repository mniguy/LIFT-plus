Mythimna convecta, the common or Australian armyworm, is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found in Australia. The term “armyworm” is used because of their habit to spread out in a line across a lawn or pasture, and slowly “march” forward, meanwhile consuming the foliage they encounter.
The wingspan is about 40 mm.
The larvae feed on a range of agricultural plants like Ananas comosus, Ipomoea batatas, Medicago sativa and Poaceae species and are thus considered a pest.
