The adult males grow up to 11–14 millimetres (0.43–0.55 in) long, while the females reach 12–18 millimetres (0.47–0.71 in) of length. The basic coloration of the body varies from light brown to greyish. The eyes are relatively large and the sides of thorax sometimes show a white or darker longitudinal stripe. The wings are scaly, oval, very short, reaching only the middle of the second rear segment, so they are unable to fly and  resemble nymphs (brachyptery). Nymphs are usually green in the early stages.
