== Description ==
Rhamnus alnifolia is a spreading shrub usually 50 to 150 cm (20 to 59 in) tall, rarely to 2 m (6 ft 7 in), its thin branches bearing deciduous leaves. The thin, deeply veined leaves have oval blades 4.5 to 11 cm (1+3⁄4 to 4+3⁄8 in) long, pointed at the tip and lightly toothed along the edges. The inflorescence is a solitary flower or umbel of up to three flowers occurring in leaf axils. The tiny flowers are about 1 mm (0.04 in) wide and have five green sepals but no petals. Female flowers produce drupes 6 to 8 mm (0.24 to 0.31 in) wide, each containing three seeds. The drupes darken to black when ripe.
