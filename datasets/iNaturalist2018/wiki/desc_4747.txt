Doriprismatica atromarginata is a species of sea slug. It is a dorid nudibranch, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusk in the family Chromodorididae.


== Distribution ==
This species is found throughout the tropical and sub-tropical Indo-Pacific area.


== Description ==
Doriprismatica atromarginata ranges in color from creamy-white through yellow to pale brown. It typically has a black-lined edge running down the outside of a very folded mantle and black rhinophore clubs. The frilly mantle sometimes appears to move like a wave as the animal crawls along. It can reach a total length of at least 60 mm. This species is very similar in appearance to Doriprismatica sibogae and Doriprismatica plumbea, although Doriprismatica atromarginata is by far the more common and is not quite as deep yellow in colour as the other species.
