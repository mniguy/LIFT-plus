The Chihuahuan spotted whiptail (Aspidoscelis exsanguis) is a species of lizard native to the United States in southern Arizona, southern New Mexico and southwestern Texas, and northern Mexico in northern Chihuahua and northern Sonora.The species is believed to be the result of extensive hybridization between the little striped whiptail, Aspidoscelis inornatus, the plateau spotted whiptail, Aspidoscelis septemvittatus, and the western Mexico whiptail, Aspidoscelis costatus. It is one of many lizard species known to be parthenogenetic.
