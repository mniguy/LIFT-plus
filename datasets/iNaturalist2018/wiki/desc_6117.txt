Symphyotrichum chilense (formerly Aster chilensis) is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae known by the common names Pacific aster and common California aster. It is native to the west coast of North America from British Columbia to Southern California and the Channel Islands. It grows in many habitats, especially along the coast and in the coastal mountain ranges. Despite its Latin name, it does not occur in Chile.
