Quercus rugosa, commonly known as the netleaf oak, is a broad-leaved tree in the beech and oak family Fagaceae. It is native to southern North America.


== Name ==
Quercus rugosa is Latin for "wrinkled oak". In Spanish it has many common names like "encino negro" (black oak) or "encino quiebra hacha" (axe-breaking oak). Colloquially it is known as "chaparro," a word which has also passed into the lexicon as slang for a short person.


== Description ==
Quercus rugosa is an evergreen shrub or tree. Bark is brown and scaly.  Leaves are thick and leathery, rarely flat, usually cupped, up to 15 cm (6 inches) long, dark green on the top but covered with a thick of reddish-brown hairs on the underside. Young leaves are also very hairy and usually red or yellow.


== Distribution ==
It is widespread in Mexico, Guatemala and the southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas). It grows extensively in the temperate highlands of central Mexico, particularly on hillsides and in narrow gorges. It is associated and usually coexists with other oaks, alders, pines and Texas madrones.
