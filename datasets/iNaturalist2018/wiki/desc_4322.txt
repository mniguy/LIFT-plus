The speckled kingsnake (Lampropeltis holbrooki) is a nonvenomous species of kingsnake which is endemic to the United States.


== Description ==

The speckled kingsnake usually grows up to 48 inches (120 cm) in total length (including tail), but the record total length is 72 inches (180 cm). The common name is derived from the pattern, which is black, with small yellow-white specks, one speck in the center of almost every dorsal scale. It is also known as the "salt-and-pepper snake".


== Geographic range ==
The speckled kingsnake is found in the central and southern United States from southern Iowa to the Gulf of Mexico. Its range overlaps that of the desert kingsnake, Lampropeltis getula splendida, and it is known to intergrade with that subspecies.


== Habitat ==
The speckled kingsnake prefers wetter habitats than other kingsnakes, like swamps and rivers, but it does commonly venture to dry areas like woodlands and grassy fields.


== Diet ==
The diet of the speckled kingsnake consists of mammals, birds, rodents, frogs, lizards, and other snakes. It kills by constriction.


== Behavior ==
When threatened, the speckled kingsnake will shake its tail like a rattlesnake to deter predators. It frequently will expel musk and feces or bite when threatened.
It is usually docile, often striking only one or two times after capture, and is frequently kept as a pet. It is commonly captive bred.


== Taxonomy and etymology ==
This snake was first described by American herpetologist John Edwards Holbrook in 1842.  At that time he called it Coronella sayi under the mistaken impression that it was the species previously described by Schlegel as Coluber sayi.  In 1902 Stejneger pointed out that because Coluber sayi is a different snake, Pituophis catenifer sayi, the name sayi could not be applied to this snake. Therefore, he proposed the name Lampropeltis holbrooki, honoring Holbrook. It was for many years considered a subspecies of L. getula, but has been elevated to full species status as L. holbrooki.
