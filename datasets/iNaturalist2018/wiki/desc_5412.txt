Corallorhiza odontorhiza, common name fall coral-root or small-flowered coral-root, is a species of orchid widespread across eastern and central United States, and reported also from Mexico, Central America, Quebec and Ontario. In North America, it occurs in forested areas up to an elevation of 2800 m (9300 feet).Corallorhiza odontorhiza is a non-photosynthetic species, with no chlorophyll. Hence it relies on fungi in the soil to supply it with nutrients. Stems are yellow to brown, bulbous at the base. There are no leaves. Flowers are typically reddish-purple with a white lip, the lip with small purple spots, though some plants are cleistogamous with non-opening flowers. The plant flowers from August through October in the eastern US.
