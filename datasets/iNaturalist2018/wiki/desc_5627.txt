Andropogon glomeratus is a species of grass known by the common names bushy bluestem and bushy beardgrass. This bunchgrass is native to the Americas, where it is widespread. It has also naturalized in other areas.
The genus name Andropogon comes from the Greek words 'aner' or 'andros' meaning "man" and 'pogon' meaning "beard", in reference to the hairs on the spikelets of certain species in this genus. The specific epithet glomeratus means "bunched", in reference to the species' bushy and broom-like inflorescences.
