== Description ==
Perityle emoryi, a polyploid plant, is quite variable genetically and in appearance. It is an annual herb growing 2 to 60 centimeters tall, its stem small, delicate, and simple, or thick, branching, and sprawling. It is usually hairy and glandular in texture. The alternately arranged leaves have blades of various shapes which are toothed or divided into lobes and borne on petioles.
The inflorescence is a single flower head or an array of a few or many heads. The head is hemispherical to bell-shaped and generally no more than a centimeter wide. The head has a center of many golden disc florets and a fringe of 8 to 12 white ray florets each just a few millimeters long. The fruit is an achene, usually with a pappus at the tip.
