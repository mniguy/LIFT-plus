The banded hickory borer, Knulliana cincta, is a species of longhorn beetle and the only species in the genus Knulliana. It is about 15–30 mm in length occurring throughout the eastern half of North America, including Mexico and the Bahamas, with one subspecies extending to the Sonoran Desert. If roughly handled it may start to squeak furiously. They are usually found on hickory trees and oak trees, where they lay their eggs; the larvae bore into the trees, sometimes doing significant damage. There are three described subspecies:
Knulliana c. cincta (Drury) - Eastern North America, Texas
Knulliana cincta ochracea (Bates) - Southeastern United States, Northeastern Mexico, Bahamas
Knulliana cincta sonorensis (Schaeffer) - Texas to Arizona, adjacent regions in Mexico
