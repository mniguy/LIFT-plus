It is unusual among Bombus species in having the hairs of the body pressed against the body surface rather than "fluffy" as is true for nearly all other species. The bumblebee is black, with two yellow bands across the thorax and the anterior part of the abdomen of the queen and worker. The male usually has only one yellow band.  The  queens  have a body length of 21–27 mm, males 19–25 mm, and workers 13–18 mm.

The bumblebee is active from March to November. Among plants visited are Bidens, Padus, blanket flower, bush clover, Eryngium, Hypericum, Monarda, sumac, and Vaccinium.
