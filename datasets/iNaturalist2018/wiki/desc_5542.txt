Trillium catesbaei, also known as bashful trillium, Catesby's trillium, or bashful wakerobin, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is found in the southeastern United States where its northern limit includes the Great Smoky Mountains and other parts of North Carolina and Tennessee. Its southernmost natural occurrence is in Escambia County, Alabama. Most of its populations are in the Piedmont from North Carolina to Alabama, under deciduous trees such as American beech, various oak and hickory species, and tulip poplar. Like most trilliums, it prefers moist, humus-rich soil in shade.
Trillium catesbaei is a perennial herbaceous plant that spreads by means of underground rhizomes. Stems are up to 45 cm tall, with white, pink, or rose-colored flowers that sometimes turn darker pink as they get older. Sometimes the flowers are hidden behind green or yellow bracts (hence the "bashful" part of one of the common names).
