== Ecology and recognition ==
It flies during the day and because of its bright colours it is often mistaken for a butterfly. Several similar species, including Dysphania subrepleta, occur in the region and some are very closely related. Dysphania alloides, which was described from the Andaman Islands, was originally considered a subspecies.Larvae have been reported to feed on Carallia species, Kandelia candel and Rhodomyrtus tomentosa plants.
