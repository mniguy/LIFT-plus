== Ecology ==
Naiads live in submerged vegetation. They don't actively chase prey but wait for it to pass by, a strategy which affords them protection from other predators. Naiads will emerge as adults at night. The adults generally fly from early June to early August, its sometimes different months. This whiteface prefers warmer habitats than many other whitefaces, and is often found sitting on lily pads in heavily vegetated ponds. It hunts from the shoreline vegetation, which this species perched on.


== Reproduction ==
After mating, the male will actively guard the female with whom he has mated by flying above her while she lays her eggs. He does this to prevent other males from mating with her. A female lays her eggs by dipping the tip of her abdomen in the water while hovering just above its surface.
