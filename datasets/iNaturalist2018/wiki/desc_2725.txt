The Blue Ridge two-lined salamander (Eurycea wilderae) is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae,  endemic to the United States. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, and freshwater springs. It is threatened by habitat loss.
The Blue Ridge two-lined salamander is found in the southern Appalachian Mountains, mostly south of Virginia.  To the north is a similar salamander, Eurycea bislineata, or the northern two-lined salamander.  Adult Blue Ridge two-lined salamanders are commonly found near stream banks. The larvae are aquatic, living in streams and seeps.
The species is named after zoologist Inez Whipple Wilder, who studied biology of Eurycea species.
These amphibians are listed by the IUCN as a species of least concern for conservation.
