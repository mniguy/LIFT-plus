Coccinella undecimpunctata has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand as a biological control agent.
In Central Europe  C. undecimpunctata  feeds on aphids associated with grasses - in fields, in ruderal biotopes, on steppe (including Pannonian steppe), stone quarries,  wastelands, dry forest edges in meadows and coastal meadow, in open habitats with grasses, near rivers. Frequently in biotopes with Ammophila arenaria it also  occurs on alluvial soils, detritus, on dead grass and in biotopes with Salix purpurea.  It is salt resistant and can feed on aphids inhabiting Atriplex tatarica and  other grasses associated with saline areas
