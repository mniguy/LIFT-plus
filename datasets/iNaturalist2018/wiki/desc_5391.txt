== Description ==
Iris virginica is a perennial plant.  The plant has 2 to 4 erect or arching, bright green, lance-shaped leaves that are flattened into one plane at the base. Leaves are 1–3 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄4 in) wide and are sometimes longer than the flower stalk. The fleshy roots (1–2 cm or 1⁄2–3⁄4 in in diameter) are rhizomes that spread underground. Pale brown, variably shaped seeds are born in three-part fruit capsules (3–6 cm or 1+1⁄4–2+1⁄4 in long, 1–2 cm or 1⁄2–3⁄4 in wide).The slightly fragrant flowers (4 cm or 1+1⁄2 in long, 7 cm or 2+3⁄4 in across) consist of 3 horizontal sepals, or "falls", and 3 erect petals. The petals and sepals can vary in color from dark-violet to pinkish-white. The sepals have a splash of yellow to yellow-orange at the crest. Each plant has 2 to 6 flowers that bloom from April to May upon a single, erect, 30–90 cm (12–35 in) tall stalk. The stalk is sometimes branched and has a slight zigzag appearance.


== Uses ==
The Cherokee use this medicinal plant for traditional medicinal uses.   The root is pounded into a paste that is used as a salve for the skin. An infusion made from the root is used to treat ailments of the liver, and a decoction of the root is used to treat "yellowish urine".It may be one of the Iris species used by the Seminole to treat "shock following alligator-bite".
