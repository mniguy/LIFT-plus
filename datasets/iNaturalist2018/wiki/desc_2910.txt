The azure-crowned hummingbird (Saucerottia cyanocephala) is a species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae.
It is found in Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua.
Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forest. The males have a metallic blue crown, while the females are identifiable by a more dull blue or greenish crown. It forages on arthropods (often searching bark and clusters of pine needle) as well as nectar from flowers. The species seems to be territorial based on how available resources are, and like most hummingbirds is likely polygamous. Its nests are generally cup shaped used from local resources, but in an urban setting the species has been known to even use objects such as telephone wires in its construction.This species was formerly placed in the genus Amazilia. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that the genus Amazilia was polyphyletic. In the revised classification to create monophyletic genera, the azure-crowned hummingbird was moved to the resurrected genus Saucerottia.
