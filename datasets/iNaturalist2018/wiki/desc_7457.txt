Oxalis dillenii, also the southern wood-sorrel and slender yellow woodsorrel, is part of the wood-sorrel family Oxalidaceae, in the genus Oxalis. Like other Oxalis species, the leaves of this plant resemble clover leaves, with three leaflets. Flowers have five yellow petals that are 4 to 10 millimetres (0.16 to 0.39 in) in length. Leaflets are 1 to 2 centimetres (0.39 to 0.79 in) wide with pointed hairs. Fruits are rather brown and 1.5 to 2.5 centimetres (0.59 to 0.98 in). It is often considered a weed, and can be found worldwide, but likely originated in North America.
