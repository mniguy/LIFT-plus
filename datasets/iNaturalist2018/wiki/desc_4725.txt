Californiconus californicus, common name the Californian cone, is a species of small, predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Conidae, the cone snails.As both the Latin name and common name suggest, this cone is found in California.


== Distribution and habitat ==
This small cone snail is unusual, in that most cone snail species are tropical, whereas this species lives in the cooler, temperate waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean, including most of the coast of California. The range of this species is from the Farallon Islands near San Francisco to Bahia Magdalena, in Baja California, Mexico. [1]
This cone is found in both rocky and sandy areas, in the intertidal zone, and subtidally down to 30 meters depth. [2]


== Shell description ==

The California cone hunts and eats marine worms, fish, and other mollusks. It is also a scavenger.
