== Distribution ==
The black-fronted nunbird is found principally in the Amazon Basin south of the Amazon River. It also occurs at the confluence of the Rio Negro (north of the Amazon) and upstream along the Amazon itself. Its range extends south and east beyond the Tocantins River towards the Cerrado region of east-central Brazil; it is also found in the Pantanal, though not the very southern portion.
The southwest and western regions of black-fronted nunbird's range occur in Amazonian Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and southern Colombia, with the Amazonian Colombian region being the southwest portion of the entire northwestern Amazon region. The species' range is mostly contiguous, although there are two localized populations in eastern coastal Brazil: the northern population in Alagoas state, and the southern locale in Rio de Janeiro state.
