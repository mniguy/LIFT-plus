The forest gecko (Mokopirirakau granulatus) is a species of gecko.  Granulatus refers to the granular texture of the skin. Its Māori name is moko pirirākau ("lizard that clings to trees"). It is endemic to New Zealand, found in all areas except the Far North, Marlborough, and Canterbury.
In June 2010 seven forest geckos, four female and three male, were stolen from a wildlife park in Northland. Forest geckos are a protected species under the Wildlife Act 1953.


== Conservation status ==
In 2012 the Department of Conservation reclassified the forest gecko as At Risk under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. It was judged as meeting the criteria for At Risk threat status as a result of it having a low to high ongoing or predicted decline. This gecko is also regarded as being Data Poor which indicates the Department of Conservations uncertainty about the listing due to lack of data.
