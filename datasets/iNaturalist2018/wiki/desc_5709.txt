Heliconia rostrata, the hanging lobster claw or false bird of paradise, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Ecuador, and naturalized in Puerto Rico. Other heliconias grow in an upright position (e.g. Heliconia bihai), their cup-shaped flower bracts storing water for birds and insects. This plant, however, has downward-facing flowers, the flowers thus providing a source of nectar to birds.Heliconias are known to those who grow them as a host flower to many birds, especially the hummingbirds. Because of its unique characteristics, it is often used as a specimen for tropical gardens.
Along with the Kantuta flower, Heliconia rostrata, known as patujú, is the national flower of Bolivia.
