== Ethnobotany ==
Early spring was called ko’oak macat (the painful moon) by the Tohono O’odham because of scarce food supplies. During this season, they turned to cacti for food and pit-roasted thousands of calcium-rich cholla flower buds.
Today's O’odham people still pit-roast or boil the cholla buds, which taste like asparagus tips.
