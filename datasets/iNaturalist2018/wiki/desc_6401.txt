=== Spain (La Mancha) ===
Formerly in La Mancha region of Spain, where Silene vulgaris leaves are valued as a green vegetable, there were people known as "collejeros" who picked these plants and sold them. Leaves are small and narrow, so it takes many plants to obtain a sizeable amount.
In La Mancha the Silene vulgaris leaves, locally known as "collejas", were mainly used to prepare a dish called gazpacho viudo (widower gazpacho). The ingredients were flatbread known as tortas de gazpacho and a stew prepared with Silene vulgaris leaves. Other dishes prepared with these leaves in Spain include "potaje de garbanzos y collejas", "huevos revueltos con collejas" and "arroz con collejas".
