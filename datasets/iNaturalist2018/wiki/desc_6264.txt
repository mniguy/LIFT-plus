The leaves are pinnate and alternate, and can reach a length of 5 cm (2 in). It blooms between July and September. The flowers are inconspicuous, the four white petals very short or absent, with 2 (rarely 4), stamens and the fruits consist of two rounded valves, notched at the apex, with a very short style between.
