Hedeoma reverchonii, commonly called Reverchon's false pennyroyal, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to the south central region of the United States, where it is primarily found in Texas, extending into small areas of Arkansas and Oklahoma. Its natural habitat is on open, calcareous rock outcrops.Hedeoma reverchonii is a robust perennial with a woody base. It produces white or lavender colored flowers in the summer. The crushed plant has an odor of camphor or lemon. This trait helps distinguish Hedeoma reverchonii from the similar-looking Hedeoma drummondii, which is a smaller plant with an aroma of peppermint.
