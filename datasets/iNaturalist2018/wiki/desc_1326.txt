Plusia putnami, the Lempke's gold spot or Putnam's looper moth, is a species of moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found in the Palearctic realm, from Japan and eastern Siberia to Fennoscandia, Great Britain, and France. In North America, it ranges from Newfoundland and Labrador to central Alaska and the interior of British Columbia, south to Pennsylvania, Washington, north-eastern California, and in the Rocky Mountains to Utah and Colorado.
The wing pattern differences between putnami and Plusia festucae are not constant. Genitalic genital dissection is needed to differentiate these two species.  The wingspan is 32–42 mm.
