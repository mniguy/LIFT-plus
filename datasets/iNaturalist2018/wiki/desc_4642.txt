The Pacific razor clam, Siliqua patula, is a species of large marine bivalve mollusc in the family Pharidae. 


== Range ==
Pacific razor clams can be found along the Pacific West Coast of North America from the eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska, to Pismo Beach, California. They inhabit sandy beaches in the intertidal zone down to a maximum water depth of about 9 m (30 ft).


== Description ==
This species has an elongated oblong narrow shell, which ranges from 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) in length in the southern portion of its range, with individuals up to 28 cm (11 in) found in Alaska. It is similar to the smaller Atlantic razor clam, Siliqua costata, which is found on the East Coast of the United States. The name razor clam is also used for the Atlantic jackknife clam, Ensis directus. While the Atlantic jackknife clam is in the same family as the Pacific razor clam the jacknife clam is in a different genus.


== As food ==
Pacific razor clams are a highly desirable shellfish species and are collected by both commercial and recreational harvesters. Razor clams, like other shellfish, may accumulate dangerous levels of the marine toxin domoic acid. Harvesters should check current public health recommendations by marine authorities before collecting razor clams. 
In the United States, razor clam harvesting is typically authorized by state officials several times a year. Harvesters locate the clam by looking for a "show," which can present as either a hole or depression in the sand. Some clams expose their siphons as the surf is receding making them far easier to spot; this behavior is called "necking".Razor clams are commonly battered and fried in butter. They can also be used to make clam chowder.
