Bidens bipinnata is a common and widespread species of flowering plant in the daisy family. It is widely dispersed in many lands, so much so that it is difficult to ascertain with certainty its region of origin. It seems most likely, though, that it is native to Asia and North America, and naturalized elsewhere. It is most commonly called by the common name Spanish needles.Bidens bipinnata is an annual  herb up to 150 cm (60 inches) tall. It produces white or yellow flower heads sometimes one at a time but sometimes several, each containing both disc florets and ray florets. The species grows in fields, forests and disturbed sites such as road embankments and fallow agricultural areas.
