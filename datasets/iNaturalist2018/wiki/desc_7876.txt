Physalis alkekengi, the bladder cherry, Chinese lantern, Japanese-lantern, strawberry groundcherry, or winter cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family Solanaceae. It is a close relative of the new world Physalis peruviana (Cape gooseberry). Unlike the rest of Physalis that is native to the Americas, this species is native to the regions covering Southern Europe to South Asia and Northeast Asia. 


== Description ==
It is easily identifiable by the large, bright orange to red papery covering over its fruit, which resembles paper lanterns. It is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 40–60 cm tall, with spirally arranged leaves 6–12 cm long and 4–9 cm broad. The flowers are white, with a five-lobed corolla 10–15 mm across, with an inflated basal calyx which matures into the papery orange fruit covering, 4–5 cm long and broad.


== Cultivation ==

It is a popular ornamental plant, widely cultivated in temperate regions of the world, and very hardy to below −20 °C (−4 °F). It can be invasive with its wide-spreading root system sending up new shoots some distance from where it was originally planted. In various places around the world, it has escaped from cultivation.In the United Kingdom it has been given the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.


== Traditional uses ==
The dried fruit of P. alkekengi is called the golden flower in the Unani system of medicine, and used as a diuretic, antiseptic, liver corrective, and sedative.


== Chemical constituents ==
Like a number of other species in the genus Physalis, it contains a wide variety of physalins. When isolated from the plant, these have antibacterial and leishmanicidal activities in vitro.
It also contains caffeic acid ethyl ester, 25,27-dehydro-physalin L, physalin D, and
cuneataside E.


== Cultural significance ==

In Japan, its bright and lantern-like fruiting calyces form a traditional part of the Bon Festival as offerings intended to help guide the souls of the dead. A market devoted to it -  hōzuki-ichi - is held every year on the 9th and 10th of July near the ancient Buddhist temple of Sensō-ji in Asakusa.


== Fossil record ==
Physalis  alkekengi seed fossils are known from Miocene of Siberia, Pliocene of Europe and Pleistocene of Germany. Pollen grains of Physalis alkekengi have been found in early Pleistocene sediments in Ludham east of Wroxham, East Anglia.
