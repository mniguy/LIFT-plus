== Distribution ==
The plant is widespread across much of Western Canada, the Western United States, and northern Baja California (México).   They tend to grow in dry meadows and on dry hillsides as well as sagebrush slopes and montane forests.


== Toxicity ==
All parts of the plant are poisonous. It is dangerous for humans as well as livestock. Consumption of 2% to 6% of the body weight of the animal is likely to be fatal. Along with other alkaloids, zygacine and other toxic esters of zygadenine are the primary neurotoxic alkaloids contributing to the plant's toxicity.
The plant is visited by a specialist mining bee, Andrena astragali, which is possibly the only bee that can tolerate its toxins.
