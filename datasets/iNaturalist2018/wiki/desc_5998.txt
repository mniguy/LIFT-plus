== Destruction of specimens ==
In 2017, Australian customs officials destroyed 106 herbarium specimens of Lagenophora that Australian scientists were attempting to re-import into the country, but the specimens' documentation was insufficient. The specimens dated to as early as the 1790s, and included six type specimens. As a result of this incident, many worldwide institutions put a temporary ban on sending museum specimens to Australia.
