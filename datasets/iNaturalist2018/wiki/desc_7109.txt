Castilleja applegatei is a species of Castilleja known by the common names Applegate's Indian paintbrush and wavyleaf Indian paintbrush.
It is native to the western United States. It is a short perennial with sticky, wavy-edged leaves. It bears bright, showy paintbrush-shaped inflorescences of small red to yellowish-red tubular flowers.
Like other species of Indian paintbrush, it is a root parasite. Although it can survive without parasitizing other plants, individuals which take a host grow faster and larger.
There are five subspecies. They are variable in appearance but distinguishable from other Castilleja species by the wavy margins and stickiness of the leaves.
