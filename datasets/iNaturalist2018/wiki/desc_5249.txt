Phlegmariurus varius, is a fir moss or club moss in the family Lycopodiaceae found in areas of Australia, New Zealand and associated islands. It has a number of synonyms including Huperzia varia.
Phlegmariurus varius can grow on the ground and as a lithophyte or epiphyte. It can have one or many branches that are spirally arranged with slender leaves that narrow to a point. The plant varies from green to green-yellow and is sometimes orange in appearance. A recent article provides morphological and genetic evidence to separate Phlegmariurus billardierei, the only species of Lycopodiaceae endemic to New Zealand, from P. varius.
