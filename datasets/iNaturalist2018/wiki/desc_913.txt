The eggs of this species are pale yellow and oval with a smooth shell.Alex Purdie describes the caterpillar of this species as:

Length, at rest, about three- quarters of an inch. Colour light-green, with indistinct whitish longitudinal lines, and a narrow median dorsal stripe of the ground colour, edged on each side by one of these whitish lines; a subdorsal whitish line on each side of the median stripe; the ground colour shows again as a lateral line, edged below with whitish. Under-side with delicate whitish or yellowish longitudinal tracings, as on the upper side. The junctions of the segments show yellowish or whitish rings when the larva contracts. Head, greenish-yellow. Body tapering somewhat to the head. The caterpillars form a chrysalis that is glossy and very dark brownish black. They can be found amongst the leaves of the forest floor. E. rosearia adults are varied in appearance. They can have a pinkish tinge or can be brownish in hue although olive green is also common.

== Host species ==
While it is endemic to New Zealand, the larvae have so far only been recorded feeding on exotic plant species: Nasturtium officinale, Plantago lanceolata, Trifolium ambiguum, Trifolium repens and Tropaeolum majus. The larvae also seem to feed on the leaves of Trifolium caucasicum.
