Trichonephila clavata, also known as the Jorō spider (ジョロウグモ（女郎蜘蛛、上臈蜘蛛）, Jorō-gumo), is a member of the golden orb-web spider genus. The spider can be found throughout Japan (except Hokkaidō), in Korea, Taiwan, China, and more recently, northeast Georgia in North America. Due to the large size as well as the bright, unique colors of the female Trichonephila, the spider is well-favored in Japan.
In 2015 scientists confirmed the first known occurrence of Trichonephila clavata in North America.In 2019, this species was moved from the genus Nephila to Trichonephila. T. clavata’s congener Trichonephila plumipes is commonly found in Australia. It was also moved from Nephila to Trichonephila, along with other 11 species including T. clavata. 


== Characteristics ==

Trichonephila clavata pass winter as eggs and scatter as tiny juveniles in the spring. The adult female's body size is 17–25 mm, while the male's is  7–10 mm.
The web of female Trichonephila can reach one meter in length; the yellow threads appear rich gold in sunlight. The structure of the web seen in cross-section is unusual for an orb web; it has 3 layers: the central orb, plus 2 irregular layers in front and behind the orb.
The adult female individual has stripes of yellow and dark blue, with red towards the rear of the abdomen. In autumn, smaller male(s) may be seen in the female's web for copulating. After mating the female spins an egg sack on a tree, laying 400 - 1500 eggs in one sack. The life cycle ends by late autumn or early winter.


== Silk ==
Researchers led by Masao Nakagaki at Shinshu University, Japan have succeeded in creating a silk thread that is stronger, softer and more durable than conventional silk by injecting silkworm eggs with genes of the spider. The silkworms that hatch weave cocoons containing 10% spider protein. The dragline silk is said to have many uses, such as: bulletproof vests, sutures after an operation, tennis rackets, fishing line, and nets. A Japanese manufacturer named Okamoto had begun developing commercial applications for the spider silk, and planned to release extra-thin, durable spider socks by year 2010.


== In folklore ==
