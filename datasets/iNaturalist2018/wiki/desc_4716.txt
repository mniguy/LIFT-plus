== Description ==
The length of the shell varies between 25 mm and 75 mm.The oblong-ovate shell is of a red brown color. It is furrowed throughout its whole extent by regular transverse striae, numerous, pretty near, interwoven by other very fine longitudinal striae. The pointed spire is composed of seven whorls. Each whorl, except the lowest, is adorned with longitudinal tubercles or ribs.  The columella projectis a little above an incipient umbilicus, which penetrates it at the base of the emargination. The ovular aperture is  provided with a callosity upon the left lip, which is of a beautiful reddish color. The pouter lip is arched, plaited upon the internal edge as often as there are striae externally.
