Faxonius virilis can be found under stones and logs in lakes, streams, and wetlands, where they hide from predators, such as fish.

Faxonius virilis feeds on a wide range of plants and invertebrates, as well as tadpoles and even small fish.

Faxonius virilis is found in southern Canada from Alberta to Quebec and in the northern United States, but has become an invasive species in parts of North America outside its native range, and was discovered in the United Kingdom in 2008. It is listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.
