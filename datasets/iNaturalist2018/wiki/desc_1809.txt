Olethreutes is a large genus of tortrix moths (family Tortricidae). It is the type genus of its tribe (Olethreutini) and subfamily (Olethreutinae).Celyphoides, Loxoterma and Paracelypha are sometimes listed as junior synonyms of Olethreutes. But the type species of the first is Tortrix flavipalpana (now Celypha flavipalpana), that of the second is T. latifasciana (now C. aurofasciana), and that of the third is Phalaena rivulana (now Syricoris rivulana). This makes Celyphoides and Loxoterma junior subjective synonyms of Celypha and Paracelypha a junior subjective synonym of Syricoris, at least according to the present delimitation of these genera.

This genus has long served as "wastebin genus" for Olethreutinae, many of which were formerly placed here but are nowadays assigned to related genera. Especially Argyroploce was included in Olethreutes by some authors even in recent times. Phiaris micana (the type species of Phiaris) has erroneously been listed in the present genus, even though Phiaris is generally regarded as distinct; its delimitation versus Olethreutes requires more study however.
The 131 species at least provisionally placed in Olethreutes today are:
