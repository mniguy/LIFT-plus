Arceuthobium campylopodum is a species of dwarf mistletoe known as western dwarf mistletoe. It is native to the low to moderate elevation coniferous forests of western North America. It is a common parasite of several species of pine tree, including Jeffrey Pine, Ponderosa Pine, and Coulter Pine. The dwarf mistletoe is a greenish-yellow structure above the bark of the tree, while most of the plant is beneath the bark. Seeds mature during the fall and disperse to nearby trees.
