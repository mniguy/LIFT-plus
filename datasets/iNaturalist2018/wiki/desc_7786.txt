Kalanchoe delagoensis, formerly known as Bryophyllum delagoense and commonly called mother of millions or chandelier plant, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. Like other members of Bryophyllum (now included in Kalanchoe), it is able to propagate vegetatively from plantlets that develop on its leaf margins.
This species' capability for vegetative reproduction, its drought tolerance, and its popularity as a garden plant, relate to this species' becoming an invasive weed in places such as eastern Australia and many Pacific islands. In the Neotropics hummingbirds sometimes pollinate this non-native plant.Kalanchoe delagoensis is unwelcome because it displaces native plants and contains bufadienolide cardiac glycosides which can cause fatal poisoning, particularly in grazing animals like cattle. During 1997, 125 head of cattle died after eating this species on a travelling stock reserve near Moree, NSW.In the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland, this species and its hybrids have been declared a noxious weed.
