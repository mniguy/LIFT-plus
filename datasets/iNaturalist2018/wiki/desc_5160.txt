Fomitopsis cajanderi is a widely distributed bracket fungus. Commonly known as the rosy conk due to its rose-colored pore surface, it causes a disease called a brown pocket rot in various conifer species. It is inedible. It is widespread in Western North America, with more prevalence in southern climates. It has a particular preference for higher-altitude spruce forests.


== Identification ==
F. cajanderi is a perennial shelf fungus. It may be identified by its small-to-medium-sized, fleshy, tough fruit-body, with a downy or crust-like top. It grows to around 3–10 cm (1.2–3.9 in) wide. The top surface is a pink colour becoming to grey, brown, or black, with a clear margin. The inside of the conk and the bottom are a rosy pink colour. The body of the fungus is rigid and can grow up to 1 cm thick. There are 3–5 round pores per millimeter.This polypore is morphologically similar to its relative, Fomitopsis rosea. Other similar species include Fomitopsis pinicola, Ganoderma lucidum, G. oregonense, and Oligoporus placentus.
