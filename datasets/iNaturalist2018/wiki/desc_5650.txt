Chloris is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family, known generally as windmill grass or finger grass.
The genus is found worldwide, but especially in the tropical and subtropical regions, and more often in the Southern Hemisphere. The species are variable in morphology, but in general the plants are less than half a meter in height. They bear inflorescences shaped like umbels, with several plumes lined with rows of spikelets.
The genus was named for Chloris of Greek myth, a figure associated with flowers and spring.
