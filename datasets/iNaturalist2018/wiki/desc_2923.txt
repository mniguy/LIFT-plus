The Cuban emerald (Riccordia ricordii) is a species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae. It is found in a wide range of semi-open habitats in Cuba, the Isle of Pines, and the western Bahamas. This bird can be observed to be feeding throughout the day, perching on a wire to rest.
This species was formerly placed in the genus Chlorostilbon. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that the genus Chlorostilbon was polyphyletic. In the revised classification to create monophyletic genera, the Cuban emerald was moved to the resurrected genus Riccordia.
