Iris × germanica is the accepted name for a species of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae commonly known as the bearded iris or the German bearded iris. It is one of a group of hybrid origin. Varieties include I. × g. var. florentina.


== Description ==
Iris × germanica grows up to 120 cm (47 in) high and 30 cm (12 in) wide.  The roots can go up to 10 cm (3.9 in) deep and it is a rhizomatous perennial that blooms mid to late spring.  Hundreds of hybrids exist representing nearly every colour from jet black to sparkling whites, except bright scarlet.


=== Biochemistry ===
It is known to produce the isoflavone irilone, and several analytical studies have been made from the rhizomes.As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.
It has had its chromosome counted several times; 2n=44, Banerji & Chaudhuri, 1972; 2n=28, Mao 1986; 2n=44 Sopova 1982; 2n=44, Váchová & Feráková, 1986 and 2n=44, Lovka, 1995.


== Taxonomy ==
It is most commonly known as 'bearded iris' and in the UK occasionally as 'common German flag'.It was first published and described by Carl Linnaeus in his book 'Species Plantarum' on page 38 in 1753.Iris germanica is an accepted name by the RHS, and it was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 8 May 1996.It is a European hybrid, rather than a true wild species. I. germanica is considered to have been a natural hybrid between Iris pallida and Iris variegata Linnaeus, both of which also have the chromosome number 2n = 24.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Iris germanica is thought to be originated in mediterranean Europe.


=== Range ===
It is widely naturalized across Europe.


== Cultivation ==
It prefers to grow in full sun, with well-drained soil. It normally retains some of its leaves over the winter period. After it has flowered and during dry conditions through the summer is best time to divide and transplant.


=== Propagation ===
It can be propagated by seed and by division.


=== Hybrids and cultivars ===
Iris germanica has many cultivars and further hybrids. These are a few known cultivars:
I. germanica var. amas was one of the most important cultivars in the creation of the modern tetraploid tall-bearded Irises.


== In culture ==

In Iran and Kashmir, Iris kashmiriana and Iris × germanica are  most commonly grown on Muslim grave yards.It has frequently been painted including 'Iris' (see right) and 'Irises' both by Vincent Van Gogh.
