Dactylophora nigricans, the Dusky morwong, is a species of morwong native to the western and southern coastal reefs of Australia where it is found down to about 60 metres (200 ft) in depth.  This species grows to a length of 120 centimetres (47 in) TL and is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries.  This species is the only known member of its genus.
