Psathyrella candolleana is mushroom in the family Psathyrellaceae. It is commonly found on lawns or pastures in Europe and North America. In 2014, it was reported from Iraq. The coloring varies between white and golden brown. The cap measures 2–8 cm (1–3 in) in diameter, and is initially conical, later becoming rounded and finally with upturned margins in maturity. The cap margin is irregular and radially asymmetrical—a defining characteristic of this species. The stalk is 4–10 cm (1.5–4 in) tall and 3–7 mm wide. The spore print is purple-brown, while spores are smooth and elliptical, measuring 6.5–8 by 4–5 µm. The specific epithet candolleana honors Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle.It is edible, but not recommended due to its poor culinary value and consistency, as well as difficulty in identification. Alternatively, the flavor is reported to be good but there is not much flesh.One similar species is Psathyrella gracilis.
