Reseda lutea, the yellow mignonette or wild mignonette, is a species of fragrant herbaceous plant.  Its leaves and flowers have been used to make a yellow dye called "weld" since the first millennium BC, although the related plant Reseda luteola was more widely used for that purpose.
A native of Eurasia and North Africa, the plant is present on other continents as an introduced species and a common weed. In Australia it is a noxious weed and pest of agricultural crops.
