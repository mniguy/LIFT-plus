It has very broad wings, and is mainly black. The short tail is white with a broad black tip. The bill is black and the legs and cere are yellow.
The sexes are similar, but immature birds are dark brown above with spotting and streaks. Their underparts are buff with dark spots, and the tail has a number of black and dusky bars. The call of great black hawk is a distinctive piping ooo-wheeeeee.

== Vagrancy ==
A great black hawk was first recorded in the ABA area on South Padre Island, Texas in April, 2018. In August of that year the same individual, based on similarities in what is highly variable immature plumage, resurfaced in Biddeford, Maine. This individual was ranked as the #1 "Craziest Vagrant of 2018" by the ABA.After disappearing for several months it reappeared in Deering Oaks park in Portland, Maine, where it remained a resident until being rescued during a snow storm on January 20th, and transported to the bird rehab facility Avian Haven. The bird was euthanized on January 31st at Avian Haven due to extensive frostbite which prevented blood from reaching either leg or foot. In January of 2020 it was mounted and is set to be displayed at the Maine State Museum.


== Breeding ==
It builds a large stick nest in a tree, and usually lays one dark-blotched whitish egg.


== Diet ==
The great black hawk feeds mainly on reptiles, other small vertebrates and large insects, often hunted on foot.  This species is often seen soaring above woodlands.  Along Amazon rivers it has been observed raiding hoatzin nesting colonies looking for eggs and chicks.
