== Description ==
Geum canadense is a herbaceous plant with basal leaves that have more than three leaflets and are arranged in a low rosette. Leaves above the basal rosette are alternate, with those placed just above the basal leaves typically trifoliate, and upper leaves usually simple. Basal leaves are a darker green and are often coarsely hairy compared to the lighter green and fine hairs found on upper leaves and stems.  In milder climates the foliage is evergreen.Blooming occurs for one to two months in the summer; each flower has five white petals and five green sepals. Flowers are replaced by clusters of long, thin seeds each with a hook on one end that may catch on clothing or animal fur.  The flowers resemble those of other members of the rose family such as blackberries and strawberries.The root system consists of a taproot and rhizomes. The plants prefer light shade or partial sun and moist to dry conditions. Somewhat unusually, they are resistant to the phytotoxins released by black walnut trees and so can grow near such trees.
