Solanum laciniatum is a soft-wooded shrub native to the east coast of Australia, notably Victoria and Tasmania.  It also occurs in Western Australia and New Zealand, where some authorities consider it to be introduced.  It is similar to Solanum aviculare, with which it shares the common name kangaroo apple. The common name refers to the likeness of the leaf shape to a kangaroo paw print. This plant is currently being cultivated to produce corticosteroid drugs.
