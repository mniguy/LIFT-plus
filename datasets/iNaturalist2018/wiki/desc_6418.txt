== Description ==
Claytonia caroliniana is a flowering, woodland perennial herb. It grows from March though June and is one of the earliest spring ephemerals. The plant grows from spherical underground tubers in light humus. They sprout and bloom before the tree canopy develops. Once the area is shaded, the plants whither leaving only the tuberous roots underground.The flowers consist of five pink and purple petals. Dark pink veins accent the petals and give them a striped appearance. The carpels are fused together. They grow on a stem 3 - 10 inches tall that bears a single pair of broad leaves. This distinguishes it from Claytonia virginica, which, although similar in other ways, has longer and much narrower leaves.  Claytonia caroliniana is similar to some of the Arctic claytonias, but is probably allied to Claytonia ozarkensis.  Natural hybrids with Claytonia virginica have been documentedThere are two green leaves that grow opposite each other on a node. The leaf has no teeth or lobes and a prominent central vein. They grow up to three inches long and 1/2 to 3/4 inches wide.


=== Uses ===
The plant is edible but its usability is limited due to difficulty harvesting and the small quantities each plant produces. Its tuberous roots are edible and rich in starch and can be cooked or eaten raw . The leaves can be eaten as well. The tuberous roots are eaten by eastern chipmunks and white-footed mice.


=== History ===
The plant was named after John Clayton. Clayton was an early collector of plant specimens in Virginia.
