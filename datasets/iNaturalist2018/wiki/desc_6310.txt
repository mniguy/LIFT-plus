Salsola kali was the botanical name for a species of flowering plants in the amaranth family, whose subspecies have been recently reclassified as two separate species in the genus Kali:

Kali tragus, formerly Salsola tragus or Salsola kali subsp. tragus: a common weed of disturbed habitats, commonly known as prickly Russian thistle, windwitch, common saltwort, or tumbleweed.
Kali turgidum, formerly Salsola kali subsp. kali: a salt-resistant plant restricted to the shores of the Baltic Sea, North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, commonly known as prickly saltwort.In 2014, Mosyakin et al. proposed to conserve Salsola kali (= Kali turgidum) as nomenclatoral type for the genus Salsola. If the proposal will be accepted, most species of genus Kali would belong to Salsola again, except for some little-known species that could be placed in the genus Soda Fourr.
