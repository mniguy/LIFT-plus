Mycena epipterygia is a species of fungi in the family Mycenaceae of mushrooms commonly found in Europe. It is commonly known as yellowleg bonnet. The species is saprotrophic and its appearance is quite variable. For example, a number of members of the genus Mycena, some parts of the fungus are bioluminescent, including in this species, the mycelium.


== Distribution and habitat ==
M. epipterygia is a common species in Western Europe (amongst others Netherlands and Belgium). It grows in diverse habitats: in deciduous and coniferous woods, but it is also found in heather and acid grasslands, amongst grasses and mosses. This species grows on the ground. In Britain, the fruiting bodies appear from August to November.


== Description ==
The cap of Mycena epipterygia has a sticky surface from which the cuticle can be peeled. The cap is striate, bell-shaped at first, but  becoming convex, or occasionally nearly flat with the margin turning up slightly. The flesh is white and fragile and the margin somewhat irregular. The cap is 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) wide and its colour varies from yellowish brown to grey-brown. The stipe, which is long and slender, about 4–9 cm (1.6–3.5 in) tall and 1–2 mm wide; it does not taper, is yellowish to yellow-green, the colour serving to distinguish this fungus from other species.The gills are white to cream, sometimes tinged with pink when older; they are fairly widely spaced, adnate, or slightly decurrent. The spores are amyloidic and have a length of 8 to 10 micrometres and a width of 4 to 5.5 micrometres. The spore print is white to very pale buff.


== Edibility ==
The species is considered edible, but is of little interest in the kitchen.


== Similar species ==
The species resembles Mycena aurantiidisca, M. clavicularis, M. leptocephala, and Roridomyces roridus.
