== Description ==
This fern has green leaves which may be up to 4-pinnate, that is, made up of leaflets that subdivide 3 times, such that the leaflets are layered with overlapping rounded segments. The leaves have a bumpy, cobbled look.
The undersides of the leaves have scales which are lengthened outgrowths of the epidermis. Tucked under the scales are the sporangia, which make the spores.
