Phegopteris connectilis, commonly known as long beech fern, northern beech fern, and narrow beech fern, is a species of fern native to forests of the Northern Hemisphere.
Unlike its close relative, Phegopteris hexagonoptera, which is terrestrial, this species is often epipetric as well as terrestrial.
This species is normally apogamous, with a chromosome count of n=90 (triploid; "3n"=90).
