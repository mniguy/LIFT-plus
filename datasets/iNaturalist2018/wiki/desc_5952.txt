It is the only species of the genus Eutrochium  found west of the Great Plains.This herbaceous perennial sometimes grows as high as 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Stems are sometimes completely purple, sometimes green with purple spots. One plant can produce numerous rose-purple flower heads in late summer, each head with  8-22 disc flowers but no ray flowers. The specific name maculatum, meaning spotted, refers to the purple spots on the stem.Spotted joe-pyeweed thrives in marshes, rich fens and swamps. It also does well in man-made moist expanses such as ditches, seepage areas and wet fields. Above all else the plant flourishes in the non-shaded environments that are also abundant in wetlands.It is a larval host to the Clymene moth, the eupatorium borer moth, the ruby tiger moth, and the three-lined flower moth.
