== Description ==
Adults show striking sexual dimorphism. The caterpillar has a greyish head and flanks, with the broad black dorsum. Setae are white. Pupa is bristly, piebald in dark grey and cream. Setae in pupa orange. The caterpillar is a minor pest on several banyan species such as Ficus benjamina, Ficus benghalensis, Ficus racemosa, Ficus pumila and Ficus religiosa. and also many crop plants like Artocarpus and Mangifera.The species is associated with an RNA virus called Perina nuda virus.
