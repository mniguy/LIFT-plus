Selliera radicans, commonly known as remuremu, swampweed or bonking grass, is a creeping, herbaceous plant species found in New Zealand, Australia and Chile.
S. radicans can grow to a height of 20 cm and spread to 2 metres wide. The shiny, narrow leaves can be up to 4 cm long, and have a spoon shape. Small, fan-shaped white flowers are produced in summer. It has been hypothesised to be the main host plant for the moth species Asaphodes frivola.
