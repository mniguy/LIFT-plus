Lindsaea linearis is known as the screw fern, as the fronds may have a twisting appearance. A small fern of widespread distribution in many parts of Australia. Found in a variety of habitats, often near swamps or moist places. By rocks, heathland or open forest. It has a dark stem, unlike the similar necklace fern, which is green.
The screw fern was first described by Swedish botanist Olof Swartz in 1801, and still bears its original name.
