Leymus condensatus, the giant wildrye, is a wild rye grass native to California and northern Mexico.


== Description ==
Leymus condensatus grows in bunches or clumps, a bunch grass, stays green all year, and has a distinctive silver blue foliage.  It is drought tolerant, growing in coastal sage scrub, chaparral, the California oak woodlands of southern oak woodland and foothill woodland, and Joshua tree woodlands, rarely in wetlands. It often hybridizes with Leymus triticoides, producing the common hybrid grass Leymus x multiflorus.
