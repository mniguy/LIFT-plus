Micranthes is a genus of flowering plants in the saxifrage family. It was formerly included within the genus Saxifraga until recent DNA evidence showed the members of what is now Micranthes are more closely related to Boykinia and Heuchera than to other members of the genus Saxifraga.All members of this genus are herbaceous, with prominent basal leaves. They are found in north-temperate, arctic, and alpine regions.
