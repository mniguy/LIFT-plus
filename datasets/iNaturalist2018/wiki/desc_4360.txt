The checkered garter snake (Thamnophis marcianus) is a species of garter snake in the subfamily Natricinae of the family Colubridae. The species is endemic to the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America.


== Etymology ==
The specific epithet marcianus is in honor of American Brigadier General Randolph B. Marcy, who led surveying expeditions to the frontier areas in the mid-19th century.


== Description ==
The checkered garter snake is typically greenish in color, with a distinct, black checkerboard pattern down its back. It is capable of growing to a total length (including tail) of 42 inches (107 cm), but is usually 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm).


== Habitat ==
The preferred habitats of T. marcianus are desert and grassland, usually close to water.


== Diet ==
The diet of T. marcianus includes small frogs, toads, small fish, and earthworms.  If kept as a pet, it can be trained on live or freeze-thawed mice, but even so, it is a fussy eater and can suddenly start to refuse mice at any point.


== Defensive behavior ==
T. marcianus will strike and bite if provoked. It will also release a foul-smelling liquid from its cloaca onto attackers.


== Venom ==
T. marcianus has been found to have mild venom.


== Subspecies ==
Three subspecies of T. marcianus are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
T. m. marcianus (Baird & Girard, 1853)
T. m. praeocularis (Bocourt, 1892)
T. m. bovalli (Dunn, 1940)Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Thamnophis.


== In captivity ==
The checkered garter snake is one of the easiest garter snakes to tame. Even a wild-caught one can become tame in a few days if handled carefully. The checkered garter snake is frequently available in the exotic pet trade, and makes a hardy captive animal. It can be trained to accept mice or fish fillets as food. Captive breeding, while not common, is done, and albino variants are being produced.
