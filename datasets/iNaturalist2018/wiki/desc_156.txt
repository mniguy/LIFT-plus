The goldenrod soldier beetle or Pennsylvania leatherwing (Chauliognathus pensylvanicus) is a species of soldier beetle (Cantharidae).


== Nomenclature ==
The specific epithet pensylvanicus is Latin for "of Pennsylvania". "The spelling with one n was in common use at the time (de Geer says in the description that the specimen was sent to him from 'Pensylvanie'), so the species name based on it can't be corrected under the rules governing scientific names."


== Distribution ==
The species is native to North America, and is one of the most common species of soldier beetle in the Midwest.


== Parasites ==
Adult C. pensylvanicus may be infected by the fungus Eryniopsis lampyridarum. Shortly before death, by unknown mechanisms, dying infected beetles tightly clamp their mandibles into flower heads; 15–22 hours later, the fungus caused dead beetles to raise their elytra and expand their metathoracic wings in order to maximise infection of other beetles. With their wings raised, the dead beetles may still attract mates as live males were observed mating with the deceased, infected females.
