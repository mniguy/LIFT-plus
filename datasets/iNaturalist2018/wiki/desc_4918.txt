Flavopunctelia flaventior is a species of foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. It was first formally described as a new species by James Stirton in 1877 as Parmelia flaventior. In 1982, Hildur Krog transferred it to the subgenus Flavopunctelia of her newly circumscribed genus Punctelia, created to contain Parmelia species with punctate (point-like) pseudocyphellae. Mason Hale raised this subgenus to generic status a couple of years later, setting Flavopunctelia flaventior as the type species of the new genus. The lichen is commonly known as the speckled greenshield. Flavopunctelia flaventior occurs in Asia, Europe, East Africa, North America, and South America.
