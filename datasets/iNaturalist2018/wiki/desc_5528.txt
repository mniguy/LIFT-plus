Fritillaria liliacea, the fragrant fritillary, is a threatened bulbous herbaceous perennial plant in the lily family Liliaceae. It is native to the region surrounding San Francisco Bay in California, USA.


== Description ==
The bell-shaped white flowers have greenish stripes and are set on a nodding pedicel of about 37 centimeters in height.  The blooms are odorless to faintly fragrant. Fritillia liliacea prefers heavy soils including clays; for example, andesitic and basaltic soils derived from the Sonoma Volcanic soil layers are suitable substrate for this species.


== Distribution ==
The range of this wildflower is over parts of southwestern Northern California, United States, especially Solano and Sonoma counties and at coastal locations south to Monterey County;  occurrence is typically in open hilly grasslands at altitudes less than 200 meters in elevation.This California endemic has been a candidate for listing as a U.S. federally endangered species, and some of the remaining fragmented colonies are at risk of local extinction, such that the species is considered locally endangered.  Example occurrences are: Edgewood Park in San Mateo County and the Sonoma Mountains foothills in Sonoma County.  Examples of highly fragmented or extirpated colonies are in San Francisco due to urban development.
