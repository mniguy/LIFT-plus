Entylia carinata, commonly known as the keeled treehopper, is a species of treehopper in the family Membracidae. It is found in Brazil, Panama, Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Keeled treehoppers are often attended by ants which feed on the honeydew excreted by the treehoppers. In return, the ants offer protection from predators. Keeled treehoppers typically feed on plants in the aster family. They are not known to transmit plant diseases and are not considered significant plant pests.
