Baccharis glutinosa is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common names saltmarsh baccharis and Douglas' falsewillow.The species has a discontinuous distribution, found in western North America (California, southern Oregon, northern Baja California) and in South America (Brazil, Bolivia, etc.). The North American populations were for many years listed as a separate species, B. douglasii, but more recent studies suggest that the plants from the two continents are better regarded as one species.
