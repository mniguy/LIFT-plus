Anemone hortensis, commonly called broad-leaved anemone, is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant with an underground rhizome, in buttercup family Ranunculaceae. The genus name comes from the Greek ἄνεμος (ánemos, meaning "wind"), as an ancient legend tells that the flowers open only when the wind blows. The species name hortensis (from Latin hortus, meaning "vegetable garden") refers to the easiness with which this plant can be cultivated.
