Vancouveria hexandra, the white inside-out flower, is a perennial herb in the barberry family Berberidaceae. It is found in southwestern British Columbia, western Washington and Oregon and northwestern California and is a common understory herb in moist, shady Douglas fir forests.This plant grows 20–40 centimetres (8–16 in) high with compound leaves in triplets and is usually found in dense patches.  It gets its name from the small delicate white flowers with petal-like sepals that are swept back abruptly as if in the process of turning inside out.  The genus honors George Vancouver, the 18th-century explorer of the Pacific Northwest.
