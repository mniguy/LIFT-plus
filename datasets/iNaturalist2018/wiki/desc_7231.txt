== Taxonomy ==
Lantana horrida was first described in 1818 by Karl Sigismund Kunth. Lantana horrida Kunth is sometimes confused with Lantana urticoides as the latter has several synonyms previously described as forms of Lantana horrida. While Lantana urticoides ranges into Texas and New Mexico, Lantana horrida has not been documented north of Mexico.
