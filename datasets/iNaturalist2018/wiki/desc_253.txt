== Description ==
Mulsantina picta is a small ladybug, typically 3.3–5.3 millimetres (0.13–0.21 in) long, and 2.2–4.0 millimetres (0.087–0.157 in) wide. The elytral markings are quite variable, and sometimes absent.  The pronotal markings are more constant and recognizable.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Mulsantina picta is widespread across the United States and southern Canada.  It is especially associated with pine forests  and is an aphid and adelgid predator. Thus making M. picta a rather dominant species in older pine trees habitats (since they are conifer specialist), which are known to have low aphid densities.
