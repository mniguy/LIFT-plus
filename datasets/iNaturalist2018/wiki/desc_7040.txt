== Description ==
Melittis melissophyllum reaches on average 30–50 centimetres (12–20 in) of height, with a minimum of 20 centimetres (7.9 in) and a maximum of 60 centimetres (24 in). It is a strongly aromatic plant with erect hairy stems. The root of this plant is a perennial short rhizome. This species is quite variable in shape of leaves and colors.  The leaves reach 5–9 centimetres (2.0–3.5 in) of length. They are oval, bluntly-toothed, quite hairy. They have a short petiole and are in opposite pairs up the stems. The inflorescence is composed of large pedunculated hermaphrodite flowers (two to six, or more)  growing in the axils of the leaves. The flowers are labiate, arranged in pairs and are one-sided (all flowers "look" at the same side). They are usually white or pale pink with a large pinkish purple blotch on the lower lip. They are mainly pollinated by bees and moths. The flowering period extends from May through August.
