Hydrophyllum appendiculatum, commonly known as the great waterleaf, is a species of plant in the borage family. It is native to the eastern United States where it is found primarily in the Midwest and Upper South.Its natural habitat is mesic calcareous forests. It is a biennial that produces lavender-colored flowers in late spring and early summer.This species can be distinguished from Hydrophyllum canadense, which has a similar appearance and broad geographical overlap, by the presence of small appendages in the sinuses of the calyx. In addition, it has shorter stamens, which are only 1-3mm exerted from the corolla (as opposed to 3-6mm).
