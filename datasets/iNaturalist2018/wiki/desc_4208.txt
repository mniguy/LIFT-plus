The dusky leaf monkey, spectacled langur, or spectacled leaf monkey (Trachypithecus obscurus) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is found in peninsular Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand; however, dusky leaf monkeys have occasionally been observed in Singapore.  It is not clear whether these monkeys are escaped pets or whether they swam to Singapore on their own volition from Johor, Malaysia.

Scan and sampling of 13 individuals (2 adult males, 8 adult females, 3 juveniles) was done by researchers from University Sains Malaysia. The researchers found that most of the dusky leaf monkeys spent their times positioning. The time that the dusky leaf monkey spent posting was estimated to be 40%. Researchers also found that the individuals spent approximately 33% of their time feeding on the leaves of the plants. In this research, researchers found these dusky leaf monkeys feeding on 10 different forest plant species on a regular basis. Dusky leaf monkeys tend to consume leaves which grow at higher elevations such as in the canopy level of a forest.
