== Subspecies ==
Subspecies include:
 Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis haemorrhoidalis (Vander Linden, 1825)
 Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis occasi Capra, 1945
 Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis asturica Ocharan, 1983
 Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis almogravensis Hartung, 1996


== Distribution ==
This species is native to parts of Europe (France, Italy, Monaco, Portugal, Spain) and North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia) surrounding the western Mediterranean. It is common in much of its range.

It lives along rivers and streams, but also in sunny larger waters. Though it may be affected by habitat changes such as water pollution.


== Description ==
Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis can reach a body length of about 45–48 millimetres (1.8–1.9 in). The abdomen length is of about 34–43 millimetres (1.3–1.7 in) in males, of 31–43 millimetres (1.2–1.7 in) in females. The length of the wings is of 23–32 millimetres (0.91–1.26 in) in males, of 25–37 millimetres (0.98–1.46 in) in the females.The males have a dark, metallic shining body, the color of which can be red-violet, golden or copper-colored. On the underside of the last three abdominal segments there red area, the so-called "red lantern" (hence the Latin species name haemorrhoidalis, meaning "blood flow").
