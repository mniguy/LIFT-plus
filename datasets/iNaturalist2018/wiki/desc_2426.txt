The goldsaddle goatfish (Parupeneus cyclostomus) or the yellowsaddle goatfish, is a species of goatfish native to the Indo-Pacific.  It is a commercially important species, as well as being sought out as a game fish, though it has been reported as carrying the ciguatera toxin.  It can also be found in the aquarium trade.
