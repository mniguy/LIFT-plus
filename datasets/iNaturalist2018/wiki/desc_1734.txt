Ceratomia undulosa, the waved sphinx, is a moth of the family Sphingidae. The species was first described by Francis Walker in 1856.  Also known as the "Scorpion Moth" (See "Biology" Below").


== Distribution ==
It is found in the United States, and southern Canada, east of the Rocky Mountains. Adult moths are strictly nocturnal, hiding away as dawn approaches (Fullard & Napoleone 2001).

Recorded food plants of the larvae include Fraxinus and possibly Quercus species.
Larvae then dig underground to pupate.
Most common predator is the Guiana Striped Scorpion, which feasts on the moth's egg clusters.  The common proximity of the two species, sometimes showing up as the moth lays her eggs, has resulted in erroneous conclusions that the moths give birth to the scorpions, and the resultant name "Scorpion Moth."
