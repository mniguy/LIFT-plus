Astrolepis is a small genus of ferns in the family Pteridaceae. It was formed in 1992 from species previously placed in Cheilanthes and Notholaena. The name is derived from the Greek words ἄστρον (astron), meaning "star," and λεπίς (lepis), meaning "scale," referring to the star-like scales on adaxial blade surfaces. Members of the genus are commonly known as star-scaled cloak ferns and are native to the Americas.
