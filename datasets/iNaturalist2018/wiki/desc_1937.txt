Xanthocnemis zealandica, commonly known as red damselfly or red coat damselfly is the most common native New Zealand damselfly. Adult damselflies are often seen flying around vegetation close to streams.
X. zealandica larvae are widespread across New Zealand, occurring in rocky and weedy streams and ponds. The larvae of the red damselfly are identified by their pointed tail gills and long hairs by the tip.
