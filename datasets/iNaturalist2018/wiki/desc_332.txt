== Distribution ==
Eristalis arbustorum occurs throughout the Palaearctic, including North Africa, as well as in North India (Indomalayan realm). In North America, the species was introduced near Toronto around 1885 and is now ubiquitous throughout much of the United States and Canada.


== Biology ==
Eristalis arbustorum is found in a wide range of wetlands and in alluvial softwood forest, temperate coniferous forests, boreal forests, taiga, and montane tundra, as well as farmland, urban parks and gardens. It visits the flowers of a wide range of low-growing plants and shrubs. The larva is aquatic, occurring in shallow, nutrient rich standing water and in cow-dung, silage pits and compost heaps. The species is known to be migratory in Europe.
