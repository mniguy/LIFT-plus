Sanguisorba canadensis, or Canadian burnet, is a perennial in the family Rosaceae native to North America, commonly growing in bogs, swamps, and roadsides from Labrador to Georgia. It grows four to five feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) tall, with creamy white flowers that grow in cylindrical spikes. Unlike its close relatives,  Sanguisorba officinalis (Great burnet) and Sanguisorba minor (Salad burnet), the leaves must be cooked to be eaten, in order to remove the bitterness.
