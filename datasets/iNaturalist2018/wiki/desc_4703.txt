Cellana is a genus of sea snails or limpets, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Nacellidae, the true limpets.


== Distribution ==
This genus occurs in the temperate and tropical Indo-Pacific oceans, Hawaii (where they are known as ‘opihi and considered a delicacy) and around Australia and New Zealand. Species are also found around the coasts of Japan, the Red Sea, Mauritius, Madagascar, South Africa and the sub-Antartarctic Islands. One species, Cellana radiata, is cosmopolitan.
These sea snails feed by grazing on green macroalgae growing on rocky substrate in the intertidal zone. Some of these limpets can live up to 7 years, however most do not get older than 2–3 years. They reproduce by broadcasting their spawn in large, yolky eggs in great numbers (between 20,000 for C. flava and C. denticulata to 230,000 for C. ornata).
