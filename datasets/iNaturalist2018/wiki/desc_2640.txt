The Mediterranean tree frog (Hyla meridionalis), or stripeless tree frog, is a species of frog found in south-west Europe and north-west Africa. It resembles the European tree frog, but is larger (some females are up to 65 millimetres (2.6 in) long), has longer hind legs, and the flank stripe only reaches to the front legs (often starting at the eyes, not at the nostrils). The croaking resembles that of H. arborea, but it is deeper and slower. 


== Distribution ==
This frog is found in central and southern Portugal, Spain (from Catalonia to Andalusia and Extremadura), southern France, northern Italy (only Liguria), Morocco, northern Algeria and northern Tunisia. It also has ancient introduced populations in Madeira and the Canary Islands and a recent introduction in Menorca.
