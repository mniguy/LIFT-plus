Symphyotrichum puniceum produces flowers between August and October. The ray florets range from dark blue or purple to white (rarely). The disc florets are yellow to cream-colored, becoming pink or purple with maturity.


== Taxonomy ==
Symphyotrichum puniceum is a variable species, and many forms have been named. As of July 2021,  Plants of the World Online (POWO) accepts one variety in addition to the autonym. S. puniceum var. scabricaule (Shinners) G.L.Nesom occurs in the southern United States from Texas to Alabama. The autonym, S. puniceum var. puniceum, occurs in most of the eastern United States and southern Canada.The species Symphyotrichum firmum is sometimes considered a variety of S. puniceum, but POWO and Flora of North America treat them as distinct species. In 1999, Calvin College botanists David P. Warners and Daniel C. Laughlin gave evidence that they should be considered two distinct species. Compared to S. firmum, Symphyotrichum puniceum is typically hairier, with purpler flowers, and does not form dense colonies but rather small clusters or scattered individuals.


== Conservation ==
As of July 2021, NatureServe listed Symphyotrichum puniceum as Secure (G5) worldwide and Critically Imperiled (S1) in Mississippi. It listed S. puniceum var. puniceum as Vulnerable (S3) in Kentucky, and S. puniceum var. scabricaule as overall an Imperiled Variety (T2) and Critically Imperiled (S1) in Texas.
