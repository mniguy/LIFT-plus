Thelocactus bicolor, the glory of Texas, is  a species of flowering plant in the cactus family, widely  distributed in the northern Chihuahuan Desert of the USA (Texas) and Mexico. Plants are usually solitary, but may form clumps. Growing to 50 cm (20 in) tall, it is a perennial with spiny, ribbed, succulent stems. Large daisy-like flowers, up to 8 cm (3.1 in) in diameter, are borne in summer. The petals are purplish-pink, fading to white. The inner petal tips form a circle of red surrounding a prominent yellow boss.
This cactus is grown as an ornamental.  A warm, dry, sunny spot in sharply-drained specialist cactus compost must be provided. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.
