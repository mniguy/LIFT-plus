Akebia quinata, commonly known as chocolate vine, five-leaf chocolate vine, or five-leaf akebia, is a shrub that is native to Japan, China and Korea, and invasive in the eastern United States from Georgia to Michigan to Massachusetts. In its native habitat, it is often found on hills, in hedges, on trees, along forest edges and streams, and on mountainous slopes.


== Description ==
Akebia quinata is a climbing evergreen shrub that grows to 10 m (30 ft) or more in height and has palmately compound leaves with five elliptic or obovate leaflets that are notched at the tip. The woody stems are greyish-brown with lenticels. The flowers are clustered in racemes and are chocolate-scented, with three or four sepals. The fruits are sausage-shaped pods which contain edible pulp. The gelatinous placentation contains seeds surrounded with white pulp, that has a sweet flavor.


== Local names ==
In China, A. quinata is referred to as 木通 – mù tōng (Pinyin) or mu tung (Wade-Giles) – meaning "woody thoroughgoing (plant)". It is also occasionally known as 通草 – tōng cǎo (Pinyin) or tung tsao (Wade-Giles) – meaning "thoroughgoing grass".


== Uses ==
The fruit contains a sweet soft pulp resembling a white dragonfruit, eaten primarily in Japan as a seasonal delicacy. The rind, with a slight bitter taste, is used as vegetable, e.g., stuffed with ground meat and deep-fried. The vines are traditionally used for basket-weaving.The stem contains approximately 30% potassium salts thus causing a diuretic action.


== Cultivation ==
Akebia prefers sandy soils with good drainage, and regular watering, though it is drought-resistant. In some areas the plant is an invasive species to be avoided. This species in considered hardy in all of the UK and Europe (down to -15 to -20°C). In the US, it suitable for hardiness zones 4-9.


== Etymology ==
'Akebia' comes from the Japanese vernacular name, 'akebi' (アケビ).'Quinata' means 'divided into five', and is presumably a reference to its lobed leaves.
