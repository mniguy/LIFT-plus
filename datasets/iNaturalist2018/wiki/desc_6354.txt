Mammillaria magnimamma, common name Mexican pincushion, is a species of flowering plant in the cactus family Cactaceae.


== Description ==
Mammillaria magnimamma  is a perennial globose plant reaching a height of 15–30 cm and a diameter of about 13 cm. At first it grows solitary, but later forms large clumps rising above ground level. Tubercules are four-sided, with latex and the axils have dense white wool. The radial spines are 2 - 5, quite variable and unequal, with dark tips, 15 – 45 mm  long. Flowers are pink or white cream with reddish midveins and a diameter of 20 – 25 mm. They bloom in mid Spring. Fruits are club shaped, dark red, about 20 mm long, and contain little brown seeds.


== Distribution ==
This species is widespread throughout central Mexico, at an elevation of 100–2,700 metres (330–8,860 ft) above sea level. Its status is listed as “Least Concern” by the IUCN Red List.


== Cultivation ==
Mammillaria magnimamma can tolerate temperatures down to 1 °C (34 °F), so in temperate zones may be placed outside during the summer months, but in winter requires protection from frost and inclement weather. It needs to be grown in a well-drained medium in full sun. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.
