Notogrammitis billardierei, the common finger-fern or strap fern is a small fern growing in high rainfall areas of south-east Australia and in New Zealand. A common plant, growing on branches, logs or on rocks in and near rainforest.Strap-like leaves are 5 to 15 cm long, and up to 10 mm wide. Occasionally broader at the end than at the base of the frond. The sporangia are grouped into sori, which grow on the underside of the frond, in irregular patterns. The sori are not round, as in many grammitids, but long and thin.
Willdenow named this species for the French naturalist Jacques Labillardière.
