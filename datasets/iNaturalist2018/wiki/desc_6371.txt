Opuntia gosseliniana, commonly known as the violet pricklypear, is a species of cactus that is native to Pima County, Arizona in the United States and Baja California, Chihuahua, and Sonora in Mexico.
Like most prickly pears, the pads are flat.  Unlike most prickly pears, they have a violet, pink, or red tinge, hence the name.  The cactus reaches mature heights of one to five feet and blooms either yellow or red.
