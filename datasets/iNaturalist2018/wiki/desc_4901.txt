Chrysothrix candelaris, commonly known as the mustard powder lichen or gold dust lichen, is a species of lichen in the family Chrysotrichaceae. It typically grows on tree bark. It does not show ascocarps or other reproductive structures, belonging to the group commonly known as the 'Fungi or lichens imperfecti' in the UK.


== Distribution ==
This lichen is widespread and common in the United Kingdom, being found on the bark of deciduous trees, especially rugged old specimens, such as sycamore, alder, oak, willow, beech, and Pinus species, normally in dry shaded parts. and occasionally on the sheltered faces of siliceous rocks. It is found in North America, Scotland, Hungary, Iran, Latvia and has been recorded in the Cape Verde Islands.


== Structure and appearance ==
As suggested by its name, C. candelaris is bright yellow, orange-yellow, or greenish-yellow.  It has a powdery (leprose) appearance, a superficial thallus and lacks apothecia, soredia and isidia. It covers the substrate like a crust and therefore belongs to the leprose group of lichens.Laundon described three chemotypes of this species: one with the chemical clycin, one with pinatric acid, and a third with both of these compounds.


== Life cycle ==
Lacking apothecia, soredia and isidia, C. candelaris is not able to reproduce by spores, but spreads by its thallus becoming distributed by the wind, the feet of animals, etc. to suitable habitats.


== Miscellaneous ==
This lichen can be used as an indicator for the air quality.
