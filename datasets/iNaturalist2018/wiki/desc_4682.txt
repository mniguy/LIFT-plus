Strombus alatus, the Florida fighting conch, is a species of medium-sized, warm-water sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Strombidae, the true conchs.


== Distribution ==
This conch occurs in the Western Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, and the east coast of Mexico.


== Description ==
The shell can be as large as 112 mm (4.4 in).This species is closely similar to Strombus pugilis, the West Indian fighting conch, which has a more southerly range.  S. alatus shells have less prominent subsutural spines and slightly more projected outer lips.  Some scientists have treated the two as distinct species; others as subspecies.   In an extensive study of the Stromboidea in 2005, Simone provisionally treated these as distinct species, but observed, "no spectacular morphological difference was found [and] all related differences, even those of the genital system, can be regarded as extreme of variation of a single, wide distributed, variable species."


== Phylogeny ==

A cladogram based on sequences of nuclear histone H3 gene and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene showing phylogenetic relationships of (32 analyzed) species in the genus Strombus and Lambis, including S. alatus, was proposed by Latiolais et al. (2006):


== Habitat ==
The minimum recorded depth for this species is the surface; the maximum recorded depth is 183 m.
