Mexican mud turtle (Kinosternon integrum), or Guanajuato mud turtle, is a species of mud turtle in the family Kinosternidae. Endemic to Mexico, it is found in Aguascalientes, Colima, Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Michoacán, México, Morelos, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Puebla, San Luis Potosí, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tamaulipas and Zacatecas, where they inhabit moist environments, such as shallow ponds, lakes, rivers or intermediate temp. tropical forest areas.


== Reproduction ==
The Mexican mud turtle's nesting season lasts from early May to September, beginning just prior to the summer rainy season. A typical clutch size for each female is 2 to 4 eggs, but can range between 1 and 8. Another distinctive feature within the species is the nostrils on male and female turtles. The females have a more rounded nostril and the nostril is more brownish as to yellow like the male. The Mexican mud turtle is an organism that "bet hedges" meaning that its organism fitness varies depending on the condition it is in. When in a relaxed, every-day state, its fitness levels are low, however when stressed its fitness level increases. Bet hedging affects this organism's reproductive window as well, allowing it to only reproduce every two to three seasons.


== Diet ==
Mexican Mud Turtles are omnivores. Some of the plants consumed include: Filamentous algae, grass seeds, guava seeds, etcetera. Some of the animals consumed include: Ants, wasps, bees, etcetera. It has been found that during the dry seasons, females tend to eat more plant matter than males.<ref>
