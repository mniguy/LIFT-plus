== Web silk decorations ==
The silk decorations of Argiope spiders are thought of as visual signals by researchers. Even though the purpose behind the silk decorations made by Argiope trifasciata remains uncertain, there are a few hypotheses: to make the spider appear larger and to act as a warning sign.
