Eristalinus taeniops is a species of hoverfly, also known as the band-eyed drone fly.


== Distribution ==
This species is present in part of Europe (Albania, Balearic Islands, Bulgaria, the Canary Islands, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Spain), in North Africa, in the Near East (Turkey, Lebanon, Israel), in the Caucasus, in the Eastern parts of Afrotropical realm to South Africa, in the Oriental realm (Nepal, Northern India), in Northern Pakistan and in Iran. It has been introduced to parts of North America (California and Florida). Recently discovered on Rio de Janeiro and Poços de Caldas, Brazil.


== Habitat ==
These hoverflies can be found in Holly oak forests, in forest clearings, maquis, rivers, streams, and in coastal marshes. 


== Description ==
Eristalinus taeniops can reach a length of 11–14 millimetres (0.43–0.55 in). These hoverflies exhibit a bee-like yellow-black drawing (Batesian mimicry) and are often mistaken for wasps or bees. The thorax has a metallic yellow-brown color and it is densely yellow hairy. Also the scutellum are yellow-brown colored. The abdomen is reddish-yellow, with transversal black bands. The compound eyes have five distinct, vertical, dark stripes. The wings are transparent, usually yellowish-brown at the base, while the halteres are brightly pale yellow colored.


== Biology ==
Adults of these hoverflies can be found from April to October with a peak from May to August. They feed on nectar of yellow and white flowers such as Erica, Daphne, Senecio and Rosaceae species. The larvae live as rat-tailed maggots, mainly in the mud, in animal carcasses and in water contaminated by pig manure.
