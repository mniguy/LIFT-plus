Calliostoma canaliculatum, common name the channeled topsnail, is a species of small sea snail with gills and an operculum, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Calliostomatidae, the calliostoma top snails.The name of the species Calliostoma canaliculatum (Sasao & Habe, 1973) is preoccupied in Calliostoma, by Calliostoma canaliculatum (Lightfoot, 1786), but not in Tristichotrochus, which is where it is placed by some authors. It is currently a secondary homonym but it has not replaced the preoccupied name because the replacement name would be synonymized sooner or later.
