Symphyotrichum laeve (formerly Aster laevis) is a flowering plant native to Canada and the United States. It has the common names of smooth blue aster, smooth aster, smooth-leaved aster, glaucous Michaelmas-daisy and glaucous aster.


== Description ==
Smooth aster is 20 to 70 centimeters (8 to 28 inches) tall. Its leaves are arranged alternately on the stems, and their shape varies among lanceolate, oblong-ovate, oblong-obovate, and ovate. They measure from 3 to 20 centimeters (1 to 8 inches) long and from 1 to 2.5 cm (3⁄8 to 1 in) wide. They are usually hairless, and the leaf edges are entire or bluntly or sharply toothed (crenate or serrate), sometimes with smaller teeth (serrulate).The flower heads are arranged in clusters (panicles). Each flower head has 13 to 23 ray florets with pale to dark blue or purple petals (laminae), and 19 to 33 disc florets that start out yellow and eventually turn purplish-red. The whole flowerhead measures 13 to 25 millimeters (1⁄2 to 1 in) across.The seeds are cypselae with pappi (bristles at their tips). Like the hairs on dandelion seeds, the pappi allow the seeds to be spread by the wind.


== Varieties ==
There are four varieties: Symphyotrichum laeve var. laeve, S. laeve var. geyeri, S. laeve var. concinnum, and S. laeve var. purpuratum.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Symphyotrichum laeve is found throughout North America. It is found naturally occurring in fields, open woods, and along roadsides. It grows in rocky or dry soil in full sun.


== Ecology ==
Symphyotrichum laeve blooms in late summer and early fall. It is pollinated by many native bees and attracts butterflies. It is a larval host for the pearl crescent butterfly (Phyciodes tharos).
