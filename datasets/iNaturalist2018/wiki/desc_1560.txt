== Description ==
Speyeria callippe can reach a wingspan of 5–6.4 cm (2.0–2.5 in). In these large and widespread butterflies the color of the upperside of the wings varies from tawny to bright red-brown with black evenly-spaced zigzag stripes. The entire outer contour is black-brown, divided by a row of pale lunules. The underside of the forewings is  red fawn, with the same design as above, and a series of marginal silver lunules. The underside of the hindwings is brown, with  about twenty-two large silvered spots and triangular silver submarginal spots with narrow brown edges. In the last stage the larvae are greyish, with black and grey patches and black-orange spines.


== Biology ==
Speyeria callippe is a univoltine species. Adults fly from May to August, usually patrolling for females, which emerge before males. Eggs are laid in litter near the host plants. Unfed first-stage caterpillars overwinter until spring, when they feed on leaves of Viola pedunculata, Viola nuttallii, Viola beckwithii, Viola douglasii and Viola purpurea.
