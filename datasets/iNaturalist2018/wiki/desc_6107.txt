Solidago uliginosa, or bog goldenrod, is a North American species of flowering plants in the sunflower family. It is found in eastern Canada (from Nunavut to Newfoundland and Manitoba) and the eastern United States (Great Lakes, Northeast, and Appalachian Mountains as far south as northeastern Georgia. There are historical reports of the species growing in Alabama, but these populations appear now to have been extirpated).Solidago uliginosa is a perennial herb up to 200 cm (80 inches or 6 2/3 feet) tall, spreading by means of underground rhizomes. One plant can produce as many as 230 small yellow flower heads in a narrow, elongate array. The species grows in bogs, marshes, and swamps.
