Eriophyllum staechadifolium is a flowering plant in the daisy family which is known by the common name seaside woolly sunflower. It is native to the coastline of Oregon and California including the Channel Islands. This is a plant of the beaches, dunes, and coastal scrub.Eriophyllum staechadifolium is variable in size, its height depending in part on its exposure to harsh coastal wind and saline spray. It may reach anywhere from 30 centimeters to 150 centimeters (1–5 feet) tall, and may be small and clumpy or quite sprawling. The leaves are up to seven centimeters (2.8 inches) long and are sometimes lobed. Each inflorescence holds several tightly packed flower heads in shades of golden yellow with centers full of 30-40 disc florets and usually a fringe of 6-6 small ray florets each a few millimeters long.
