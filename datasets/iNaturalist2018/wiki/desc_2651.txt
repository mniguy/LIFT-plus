The Sierran chorus frog or Sierran treefrog (Pseudacris sierra) has a range from the West Coast of the United States from Central California inland through Idaho. They live from sea level to more than 10,000 feet in many types of habitats, reproducing in aquatic settings. They occur in shades of greens or browns and can change colors over periods of hours and weeks.


== Taxonomy ==
The naming of this frog has a very confusing history. These frogs have long been known as Pacific chorus frogs Pseudacris regilla. Then, in 2006, Recuero et al. split that taxonomic concept into three species. Recuero et al. attached the name Pseudacris regilla with the northern piece, renaming the central piece the Sierran tree frog (Pseudacris sierra) and the southern piece the Baja California tree frog (Pseudacris hypochondriaca). Because the paper provided no maps or discussion of how to diagnose the species, it has been an extremely controversial taxonomic revision, but has been incorporated into Amphibian Species of the World 6.0 (as Pseudacris sierra). The taxonomic confusion introduced by this name change means that much of the information about Pseudacris sierra is attached to the name Pseudacris regilla.
