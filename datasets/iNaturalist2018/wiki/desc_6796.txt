Stylosanthes biflora, known by the common name sidebeak pencilflower, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the Southeastern United States where it is widespread in open areas of native vegetation. It producers yellow-orange flowers in the summer and fall.
This species is highly variable throughout its range, and numerous species had previously been segregated out of it. However, their morphological differences have been found to be so overlapping that the former segregates are now considered the same species.
