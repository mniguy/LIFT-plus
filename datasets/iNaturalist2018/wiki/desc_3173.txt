The white-necked puffbird (Notharchus hyperrhynchus) is a species of puffbird in the family Bucconidae.
It is found in forest and woodland from southern Mexico through Central America to the Chocó, northern Colombia (including Magdalena Valley), northern Venezuela, and the western and southern Amazon Basin.
This bird measures 25 cm (9.8 in) long. It is mainly black and white, with a prominent black band separating the white chest and belly. This is contrasted on the back with a white neck band separating the black back from the crown. A black eyestripe runs from the beak to the crown, passing through a dark red eye. The bill is massive and black.
It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Guianan puffbird (N. macrorhynchos). The two differ markedly in bill-size (N. hyperrhynchus larger-billed than N. macrorhynchos), plumage (among other things, N. hyperrhynchus has less black to the flanks and more white to the forecrown than N. macrorhynchos), and voice. Consequently, the two were separated by SACC in 2004.
