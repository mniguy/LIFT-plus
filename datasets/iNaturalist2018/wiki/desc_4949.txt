Stereocaulon ramulosum is commonly known as snow lichen, a terriclous fruticose lichen belonging to the family Stereocaulaceae. It has cosmopolitan distribution. In the Australasian region it is common in eastern Australia, New Zealand and also recorded at Lord Howe Island and Macquarie Island.The habitat is often cooler moist areas with a high level of cloud cover. It may be found on rocky ground or as an epiphyte on tree branches. Stereocaulon ramulosum was the first lichen known to contain an amylose polysaccharide.This species is unusual, as the fungal component is associated with two different chlorophyll forming species, usually there is only one. The more significant one is a green alga which gives the characteristic colour. The second is a cynobacteria which is found in the cephalodia, a wart-like structure. Three different kingdoms are represented in this single life form; Fungi, Protista and Eubacteria.The generic name Stereocaulon is derived from ancient Greek stereós and Latin caulis, referring to the hard stem of the central part of the lichen. The specific epithet ramulosum is derived from the Latin ramulose, and means "having many small branches".
