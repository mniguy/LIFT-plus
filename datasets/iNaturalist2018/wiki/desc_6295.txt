== Description ==
This is a short, sprawling perennial herb reaching a maximum height near 30 centimeters. The branching stems grow along the ground or slightly upright and may be up to a meter- 3 feet long. The plentiful leaves are oval in shape and are 1 to 4 centimeters long. The foliage and sometimes the stems are rough with whitish scaly surfaces.
The plants are monoecious, with individuals producing male and female flowers. The staminate (male) flowers grow in rounded clusters and lack bracts. The pistillate (female) flowers are oval or round ovaries surrounded by spongy bracts. They develop into fruits containing small seeds.
The bloom period of this species is one of the longest of the Atriplex genus. It blooms from April to October.
