It is native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada.Hypericum virginicum is a small herbaceous plant growing up to 70 cm (28 in) in height. Its leaves are sessile and opposite, sometimes clasping. The flowers grow up to 15 mm (0.6 in) in diameter, with 5 pink petals. It flowers in the summer to early fall and grows in bogs, wet meadows, fens, swamps, and along lakeshores.
