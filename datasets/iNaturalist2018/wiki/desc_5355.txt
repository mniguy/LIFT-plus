In Britain it is one of three native species of the genus, the others being P. odoratum and P. verticillatum.

It is valued in cultivation for its ability to colonise shady areas, and is suitable for a woodland style planting.The specific epithet multiflorum means "many-flowered".The hybrid Polygonatum × hybridum (P. multiflorum × P. odoratum) has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
