Pseudopanax arboreus or five finger (Māori: 'puahou' or 'whauwhaupaku'), is a New Zealand native tree belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is one of New Zealand's more common native trees, being found widely in bush, scrub and gardens throughout both islands. The compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, hence the common name, are very characteristic of the tree and easily recognized.
Closely related and very similar to five finger are P. laetus, P. colensoi and P. macintyrei.
