== Description ==
Crataegus douglasii is a compact erect bushy shrub covered in fan-shaped green leaves with teeth along the distal margin. Thorns along the branches are one to two centimeters long.
White flowers with greenish centers grow in bunches at the ends of each thin branch. The fruit is a very dark purple pome up to about a centimeter across. The fruits were a good food source for Native American peoples such as the Cheyenne and Nlaka'pamux.


== Ecology ==
The foliage is browsed by cattle and sheep, and various birds, including quail, the Hungarian partridge, and ring-necked pheasant, feed on the berries. It is a larval host to the gray hairstreak, mourning cloak, pale tiger swallowtail, and western tiger swallowtail.
