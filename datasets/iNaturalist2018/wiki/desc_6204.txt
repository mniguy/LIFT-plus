The Virginia waterleaf or eastern waterleaf (Hydrophyllum virginianum, often misspelled as virginicum) is an herbaceous perennial plant native to Eastern North America. The plant sometimes spreads by rhizomes to form large colonies in wooded areas. It can also spread by seeds. The seedling usually appear early to mid-spring. Flowers are blue, white, or purple, appearing in mid to late spring.  Flowers exposed to sunlight
bleach rapidly. Often the newer leaves are solid green with white spots appearing as they age and later disappearing in early summer. It prefers shade.
