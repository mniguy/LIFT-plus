Pinus pseudostrobus, known in English as the smooth-bark Mexican pine and in Spanish as chamite or pacingo, is a tree found in forests of Mexico and Central America. 
It is 8 to 25 m tall with a dense and round top.It is threatened by logging and wood harvesting. The bark is brown and fissured and smooth when young. It is subject to ex-situ conservation. It grows at altitudes between 850 and 3250 m. from 26° to 15° north latitude, from Sinaloa, Mexico to Nicaragua and Honduras. It occurs within a rainfall regime that rains mostly in summer.A stand of about 15 fully mature smooth-bark Mexican pines is in Imperial County, California, at the Palo Verde County Park, in a narrow strip of land between Hwy 78 and the Colorado River.English botanist John Lindley described the species in 1839. It is divided into Pinus pseudostrobus var.apulcensis (Lindl.)Shaw (Alpuco pine), Pinus pseudostrobus f.protuberans Martìnez and Pinus pseudostrobus var.pseudostrobus.It has been introduced in New Zealand near sea level and has done well.
