The red morwong (Morwong fuscus) is a morwong, a species of fish found off southeast Australia and the North Island of New Zealand from shallow depths to at least 55 m, on rocky reef and coastal areas.  Its length is between 30 and 60 cm.


== Systematics ==
Although the red morwong is usually classified in Cheilodactylus, DNA studies published in the early 2000s recover Cheilodactylus fuscus as closer to the latrid genus Nemadactylus than to the Cheilodactylus type species. In the meantime, John E. Randall has recommended using the generic name Morwong for "C." fuscus.
