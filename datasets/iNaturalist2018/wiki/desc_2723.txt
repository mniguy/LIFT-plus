The dwarf salamander (Eurycea quadridigitata) is a species of salamander native to the southern United States, from North Carolina to Oklahoma, south to Texas along the Gulf of Mexico states to northern Florida. Some sources refer to it as the four-fingered manculus, dwarf four-toed salamander, or the Florida dwarf salamander.


== Taxonomy ==
A review of E. quadridigitata published in 2017 identified five cryptic species within E. quadridigitata based on molecular evidence.
Eurycea chamberlaini Harrison and Guttman, 2003: North Carolina and interior areas of South Carolina
Eurycea sphagnicola Wray, Means, and Steppan, 2017: Southern Mississippi, Alabama, and far western Florida panhandle
Eurycea hillisi Wray, Means, and Steppan, 2017: interior regions of Alabama and Georgia
Eurycea paludicola (Mittleman, 1947): Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas
Eurycea quadridigitata (Holbrook, 1842): Florida, coastal areas of Georgia, and South Carolina


== Description ==

The dwarf salamander grows from 2.0 to 3.5 inches in length. It has a slender body and a long tail. It is typically yellow-brown in color with darker brown blotching and dark stripes down each side, but the pattern and coloration can vary widely. The epithet quadridigitatat is to denote that each of its feet has four toes.


== Behavior ==
The dwarf salamander prefers habitats of swampy pine woods. It is nocturnal and spends most of its time under leaf litter or forest floor debris. Breeding occurs in the fall, with 12 to 48 eggs being laid singly or in small clutches attached to submerged debris in shallow, slow moving or still water.
