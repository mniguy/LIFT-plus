Tricholomopsis rutilans, known by the unusual but apt common name of Plums and Custard or, less commonly Red-haired agaric, is a species of gilled mushroom found across Europe and North America.


== Description ==
A striking and easily recognised fungus, Plums and Custard takes its common name from its plum-red scaled cap and crowded custard yellow gills. The flesh is cream-coloured and spore print creamy white. The base colour of the cap under the scales is yellow. The cap is convex and 3–12 cm (1.2–4.7 in) across. The stipe (stem) is cylindrical and 5–10 cm (2–4 in) tall and 1–2.5 cm wide with a red scaly base developing to a yellow colour towards the cap. It has no ring or volva.


== Distribution and habitat ==

Tricholomopsis rutilans can be found growing on tree stumps and logs (especially those of spruce) in coniferous woodlands throughout the northern hemisphere, in places as diverse as Ireland, Bulgaria, Ukraine and North-West Russia, in late summer and autumn (June until November). It has also been found, probably accidentally introduced, in Australia and Costa Rica on introduced pine trees.


== Edibility ==
Many older texts list T. rutilans as apparently able to be eaten after boiling, though not recommended. A couple of more recent books list it as poor quality.


== Similar species ==
A related species, Tricholomopsis decora, is also found in conifer woods but is golden in colour, much less common and found at higher altitudes. Megacollybia fallax is similar but with a gray-brown cap.
