Acrida cinerea, sometimes called the Oriental longheaded grasshopper/locust or the Chinese grasshopper (though this name is also applied to Oxya chinensis), is a member of the Acrididae family. Like other members of the genus Acrida, Acrida cinerea lacks stridulatory organs on its legs and so they do not make noise whilst moving.Historically it has been used as a human food source, and it has been investigated for its nutritional value for the poultry industry (e.g., Wang et al. 2007).
