The Blackfoot apply a poultice of chewed roots  to swellings, to "diarrhea rash", to rashes, to the sore gums of nursing infants and to sore eyes. They also chew the root for sore throats, and use the plant to spice soups, and use the fresh roots for food. The Brulé Lakota give pulverized roots to children with diarrhea, and  an infusion of the whole plant is taken by mothers to increase their milk.
