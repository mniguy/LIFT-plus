Ribes bracteosum, the stink currant, is a species of currant native to western coastal North America from southeastern Alaska to Mendocino County in California.
Ribes bracteosum is a deciduous shrub, without thorns, growing to 3 m (10 feet) tall. The leaves are 5–20 cm (2-8 inches) across, palmately lobed with 5 or 7 lobes. The flowers are produced in spring after the leaves emerge, on racemes 15–30 cm (6-12 inches) long containing 20-40 flowers; each flower is 5–10 mm (2-4 inches) in diameter, with five white or greenish-tinged petals. The fruit, born in clusters, is dark blue with a whitish bloom, edible but sometimes unpleasant.
