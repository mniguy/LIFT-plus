The campo flicker (Colaptes campestris) is a species of bird in the woodpecker family. It is found in a wide range of open and semi-open habitats in eastern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northeastern Argentina, with isolated populations in Amapá and southern Suriname. Though it frequently can be seen in trees or bushes, it is among the very few woodpeckers that spends a significant portion of its life on the ground. It breeds in holes in trees, termite mounds or earth banks. It is generally common and therefore considered to be of least concern by IUCN.
The southern population has a white throat (instead of a black throat) and is sometimes considered a separate species, the pampas flicker (Colaptes campestroides).
