The American rubyspot (Hetaerina americana) is a damselfly of the family Calopterygidae.
Males have a lustrous red head and thorax. The abdomen of both genders is brilliant green.
The female may have either green or copper colored marks on the thorax.

		
During mating, a male uses claspers at the end of his abdomen to grab a female behind the head, and the female bends her abdomen to engage segments 2–3 of the male, where sperm is stored, forming a "wheel" or "valentine". The male forcefully expels sperm stored by the female from prior matings before injecting his own.
