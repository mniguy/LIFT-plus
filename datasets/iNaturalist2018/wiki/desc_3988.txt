Phalacrocorax is a genus of fish-eating birds in the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae.


== Taxonomy ==
The genus Phalacrocorax was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) as the type species. Phalacrocorax is the Latin word for a "cormorant".

The genus contains 22 species including one species that became extinct in the 19th century.

=== Alternative taxonomies ===


==== IUCN / BirdLife taxonomy ====
A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that the genus Phalacrocorax was non-monophyletic and that a group of five species currently placed in this genus were more closely related to members of Leucocarbo. This group contained the rock shag, the double-crested cormorant, the neotropic cormorant, the flightless cormorant and the European shag. Under this study, Phalacrocorax was split into multiple genera, and now contains only 12-15 species within itself:
Genus Poikilocarbo:
Red-legged cormorant or red-footed shag, Poikilocarbo gaimardi
Genus Urile:
†Spectacled cormorant or Pallas's cormorant, Urile perspicillatus
Brandt's cormorant, Urile penicillatus
Pelagic cormorant or Baird's cormorant, Urile pelagicus
Red-faced cormorant, Urile urile
Genus Phalacrocorax:
Japanese cormorant or Temminck's cormorant, Phalacrocorax capillatus
Great cormorant or black shag, Phalacrocorax carbo (paraphyletic; could represent up to 4 species when capillatus and lucidus are considered distinct)
White-breasted cormorant, Phalacrocorax lucidus
Cape cormorant, Phalacrocorax capensis
Black-faced cormorant, Phalacrocorax fuscescens
Australian pied cormorant or yellow-faced cormorant, Phalacrocorax varius
Little black cormorant, Phalacrocorax sulcirostris
Pitt shag or Featherstone's shag,  Phalacrocorax featherstoni
Spotted shag, Phalacrocorax punctatus
Indian cormorant, Phalacrocorax fuscicollis
Socotra cormorant, Phalacrocorax nigrogularis
Bank cormorant or Wahlberg's cormorant,  Phalacrocorax neglectus
Genus Gulosus:
European shag or common shag, Gulosus aristotelis
Genus Nannopterum:
Double-crested cormorant or white-crested cormorant, Nannopterum auritus
Neotropic cormorant or olivaceous cormorant, Nannopterum brasilianus (or Nannopterum olivaceus)
Flightless cormorant, Nannopterum harrisi
Genus Leucocarbo:
Rock shag, Leucocarbo magellanicus, along with the 15 other species previously classified into Leucocarbo.The study's findings were adopted by the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International. 


==== Clements taxonomy ====
The taxonomy adopted by the Clements Checklist classifies all cormorants aside from those already in Microcarbo into Phalacrocorax, leaving just two cormorant genera: Phalacrocorax and Microcarbo.
