It has naturalized elsewhere, including parts of Australia.

== Cultivation ==
Croton setigerus is used as an ornamental plant, its low and rounded form fills a pot.
The foliage is toxic to animals, and the crushed plants were used by Native Americans to stupefy fish and make them easy to catch. When crushed, the leaves have a sweet odor that some find unpleasant.
Despite the plant's toxicity to some species, the seeds are eaten by birds. The common names of the plant come from the affinity of doves and wild turkeys for the seeds.
