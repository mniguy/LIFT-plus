Gloeophyllum sepiarium (Rusty gilled polypore) is a wood decay fungus that causes a brown rot. Gloeophyllum sepiarium grows in thin, dark brown/green brackets on dead conifers. Often found on wood in lumberyards, the fruiting body grows for only one year, and produces spores in late summer and autumn. Its hymenial surface is distinctive from other polypores due to the presence of gills. Gloeophyllum sepiarium is inedible.The cap is 2–15 wide, loosely fan-shaped, brown with a yellow-orange margin during growth, velvety then smooth, and leathery with a mild odor and taste. The spores are white, cylindrical, and smooth.Similar species include Daedalea quercina, Lenzites betulina, and Trametes versicolor.
