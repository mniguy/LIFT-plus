== Etymology ==
The former genus name Trientalis is derived from the Latin triens ('a third'), and is an allusion to the height of the plant, which is one third of a foot, or 4 in (10 cm) high. Latifolia is derived from the Latin words latus ('broad or wide') and folia ('leaves') and means approximately 'broad-leaved'.The alternative name "Indian potato" refers to a small subterranean swelling at the stem's base, which is not listed as being edible by modern sources.
