Scorzoneroides autumnalis, commonly called autumn hawkbit,  is a perennial plant species, widespread in its native range in Eurasia (from Europe east to western Siberia), and introduced in North America.The plant is sometimes called fall dandelion, because it is very similar to the common dandelion (one of the main differences being a branched stem with several capitula), but "yellow fields", covered by this plant appear much later than dandelions, towards the autumn in the Eastern Europe. In the Latin synonym of the plant name, Leontodon autumnalis,"leontodon" means "lion's tooth", the same as "dandelion".
