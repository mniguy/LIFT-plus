It is found in North America, where it has been recorded from Maine to southern Quebec and Ontario, south to Florida and Mexico. It has also been recorded from Iowa, Colorado, California and the West Indies. Its habitat consists of fields and gardens.

The wingspan is 17–23 millimetres (0.67–0.91 in). The forewings are orange, brown or grayish brown. The hindwings are similar but lighter. Adults are on wing from April to November in the south. There may be up to four generations per year in the south.
