Polistes comanchus is a species of paper wasp from northwestern Mexico to the south central United States.


== Taxonomy ==
It was described in 1857 by Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure using a collection from Nuevo México - this does not correspond to the modern state of New Mexico, but at the time was a formerly Mexican territory which had recently been conquered and annexed by the USA, and included everything in between modern Nevada to east Texas. He had travelled to this region in 1856.
In 1978 Owain Richards classified P. comanchus in a subgenus he named Aphanilopterus after an old synonym of P. lanio by Fernand Anatole Meunier, he further placed it in a "species group 1".
