The list of marine animals of Australia (temperate waters) is a list of marine and shore-based species that form a part of the fauna of Australia. This list includes animals which either live entirely marine lives, or which spend critical parts of their lives at sea.
The geographical range is south of Perth, Western Australia and the border of New South Wales and Queensland, including the whole of the coasts of South Australia and Tasmania and their offshore islands. Tropical species which are also found in this range may also be listed here.
The listed organisms are generally identifiable to the naked eye. Many microscopic animals also inhabit this region.
Ranges are generally given relating to Australian waters. If listed as endemic, they have been found only in the listed range. Others may have much greater ranges.
