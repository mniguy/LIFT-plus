Porcellio laevis (commonly called the swift woodlouse, dairy cow isopod, or smooth slater in Australia) is a species of woodlouse in the genus Porcellio. As the species epithet laevis as well as the vernacular name "swift woodlouse" suggests, the species is capable of quick bursts of speed when provoked.
This species of woodlice is distinctively large, appearing up to 20mm long with a smooth dorsal surface. The males can be identified by their long, spear-shaped uropods
It is commonly kept as a pet due to its somewhat easy care requirements and the variety of color morphs available. The species is easy to keep and can be easily established in a terrarium within a few weeks.


== Distribution and Habitat ==
Porcellio laevis was first recorded in Britain in the 13th century but it likely originated in North Africa. It as has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been introduced to Australia, including Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. The species is also found in North and South America, Western Asia, Japan, Australia and some Pacific islands.This species is found under rocks and fallen logs in damp areas, and is otherwise rarely encountered. Records from Ireland and Britain also place them in agricultural areas like gardens, farms, and stables where they can be found in dung and compost piles.


== Development and Maternal Care ==
Porcellio laevis directly develop from yolky eggs. Both the eggs and juveniles develop within a brood pouch called a marsupium until the first juvenile stage. The use of the marsupium eliminates the need for there to be an external water source for early development since it is filled with fluid from the mother isopod. This is considered some of the most extensive parental care among terrestrial arthropods.
