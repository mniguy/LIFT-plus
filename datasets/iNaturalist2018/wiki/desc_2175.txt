== Distribution ==


=== Native ===
Procambarus acutus is native to parts of the United States. It has a disjunct native distribution which includes the Atlantic Slope, as well as the southern Great Lakes drainages to the Gulf of Mexico. On the Atlantic Slope, P. acutus occurs from Maine to Georgia. Procambarus acutus also occurs from southern Wisconsin and Michigan through Kentucky and Missouri to western Texas and the Florida panhandle.


=== Introduced ===
Procambarus acutus has spread beyond the American states it is native to and is now found in most of the Continental US.These crayfish are also found in Egypt, Great Britain, and the Netherlands however there is insufficient information at this time to assess their degree of establishment or invasiveness. Invasion is possible.The White River Crayfish was first located in Belgium in 2019. Specifically, the subspecies P. a. acutus was found. This sighting in East Flanders makes it the fourth confirmed location outside of the USA. Although it has become established elsewhere, and is potentially invasive in East Flanders, it is not yet certain that it is invading or even established in that location.
