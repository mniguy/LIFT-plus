Sphenarium purpurascens (Spanish: Chapulín de milpa and Portuguese: Gafanhoto-do-milho, i.e., corn-field grasshopper), is a grasshopper species in the genus Sphenarium found in Mexico and Guatemala.
The harvesting of the grasshoppers in Mexico for human consumption can be a way for managing pest outbreaks. Such strategies allow decreased use of pesticide and create a source of income for farmers.
