Leucoagaricus leucothites, white dapperling, or white Agaricus mushroom, is a species of agaric fungus. The species was originally described as Agaricus leucothites by Carlo Vittadini in 1835. Solomon Wasser transferred it to Leucoagaricus in 1977. While sometimes regarded as edible, the species is suspected of being poisonous due to gastric-upset-causing toxins. It could also be confused with the deadly Amanita ocreata.The white mushroom's cap is 4 to 15 cm wide. Its stipe is 5 to 12 cm long, commonly with a wide base, and bruising yellow or brown. The spores are white, smooth, and elliptical.
