The ocean surgeon or ocean surgeonfish (Acanthurus bahianus) is a tropical fish known to live in reefs in the Atlantic Ocean. It is edible, and occasionally marketed fresh, but they are more often used as bait, or in the aquarium trade.


== Description ==
Ocean surgeons are known by their oval bodies with uniform color (usually blue-gray to dark brown), the pale to dark marking around the eyes, and the light yellow is now found on their bodies. Most have blue or white markings on the dorsal fin, anal fin, and tail fins and pale bands can sometimes be seen at the base of their tails. They often swim in schools with other species such as the Atlantic blue tang surgeonfish. They have been recorded up to 38 cm (15 in) in length.
Ocean surgeons have a total of 9 spines on their Dorsal fins and between 23 and 26 soft rays. Their anal fins have only 3 spines and between 21 and 23 rays. Their caudal fins are roughly emarginate, and the surgeonfish's body and head are both deep and compressed.


== Distribution ==
Ocean surgeons inhabit coral reefs, where they feed on algae. They can be found in southern Brazil, and east to Saint Helena and Ascension Island.
