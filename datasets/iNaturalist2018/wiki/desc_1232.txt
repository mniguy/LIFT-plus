Acronicta oblinita, the smeared dagger moth or arioch dagger, is a moth of the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by James Edward Smith in 1797. It is found in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia west across Canada to British Columbia, north to Lake Athabasca and south to Florida and Texas. 

The wingspan is 36–54 mm. Adults are on wing from May to July in one generation depending on the location. The forewing is brown and the hindwing is off white. Specimens from the southern states are larger and much paler than typical specimens from further north
The larvae feed on various forbs, shrubs, and trees. They are considered an occasional pest in the fruit industry due to defoliation of the host plants.
