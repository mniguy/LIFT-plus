== Description ==
Dryopteris arguta is somewhat variable in appearance. Leaflets sometimes turn at an angle from the leaf, giving it a ruffled or lacy look, and the toothed leaflets may have bristles at their tips. According to C. Michael Hogan, The thin concave indusia are quite closely spaced and almost entirely cover the sporangia.
