Acanthurus achilles, commonly known as Achilles tang or Achilles surgeonfish, is a tropical marine fish native to the Pacific Ocean.


== Description ==
They are a medium surgeonfish reaching a maximum of 25 cm (10 in) at adulthood. Acanthurus achilles are black with striking orange and white lining along the fish's fins and tail. When the fish matures, a prominent orange drop shape develops on the caudal area, terminating into a sharp spine.


== Diet ==
The Achilles tang is herbivorous, eating mostly benthic algae. They will also accept frozen and meaty foods such as brine shrimp and mysis shrimp in captivity. As with all surgeonfish, algae or similar vegetable matter should be included in their dietary intake to moderate aggression and regulate metabolic functions.


== Distribution and habitat ==
It is found in various reefs of Oceania, up to the islands of Hawaii and Pitcairn. The fish is also, although less commonly, found in the Mariana Islands and even some reefs in southern Mexico and Guatemala.
