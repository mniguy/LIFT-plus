Bufo bankorensis (vernacular names: Central Formosa toad, Bankor toad) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to Taiwan and widely distributed at elevations up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea level. There has been doubts about its separatedness from Bufo gargarizans from China and even other species, but it is currently considered a valid species.

== Habitat and conservation ==
Bufo bankorensis are found in a range of habitats at elevations up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft): broadleaf forests, cultivated fields, mixed forests, and orchards. They can be seen foraging on insects under street lights during rainy nights. Breeding can take place in both streams and pools. One study found that a temperate population could breed throughout the year, while a subtropical population only bred during the cooler part of year, from September to March.While Bufo bankorensis is a very common species, habitat loss remains a threat to it. It is also collected for food and traditional medicine.
