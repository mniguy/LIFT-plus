Pachycormus is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the cashew family.  The generic name refers to pachy for "thick" and kormos for "stump," referring to the thick caudiciform trunk. The specific epithet dis refers to a negation of color.   The single species is Pachycormus discolor endemic to the Baja California peninsula.
Called the Baja elephant tree, torote blanco, or copalquín, plants are grown in containers by caudiciform succulent aficionados.  There are 2 to 3 subspecies.  Only seed grown specimens develop the caudex.  Note: the common name "elephant tree" is also applied to Bursera microphylla as well as other species.
