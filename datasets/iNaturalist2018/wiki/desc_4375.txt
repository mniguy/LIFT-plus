Anolis cybotes, the large-headed anole, also known as the Tiburon stout anole, largehead anole or the Hispaniolan stout anole, is a species of anole native to Hispaniola and nearby small islands. It has also been introduced to Suriname and South Florida, with small but stable breeding populations. This species gets its name from the male's strangely large head. It is often brownish in color with lighter stripes on the flanks.
