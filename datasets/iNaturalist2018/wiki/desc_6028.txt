Olearia ilicifolia is a shrub or small tree endemic to New Zealand. Common names include Maori-holly, mountain holly, hakeke or hakekeke and New Zealand holly. It is a spreading shrub or small tree of the family Asteraceae, and has largely serrated and undulating grey-green leaves. It is closely related to the sub-alpine Olearia macrodonta, with which it shares the names mountain holly and New Zealand holly, however it is much more common than Olearia macrodonta. It is found in lowland and sub-alpine forests from sea level to 1,200 metres (3,900 ft).
