Eriophora pustulosa, commonly called the garden orb weaver spider, is a common small species of spider found in Australia and New Zealand. The colour of the species varies widely, but they are often brightly coloured.
Eriophora pustulosa has five distinctive spines on its abdomen, two large ones halfway down its back and three smaller ones at the end of its abdomen.
At night the spider constructs a circular web that it waits in the middle of for prey to fly into.
