The only other records in the south are from the type locality of Georgia and a record from Liberty County in north-western Florida. These possibly represent strays.The wingspan is about 45 mm. Adults are on wing from June to September.
The larvae mostly feed on woody plants, including Humulus lupulus, Populus tremuloides, Laportea canadensis and Rubus.
