== Description ==
Plants grow 7 to 60 cm (2+3⁄4 to 23+1⁄2 inches) tall, from a caudex (woody-like perennial base), flowering spring to mid summer but often found flowering till late summer. They have 3-10 basal leaves that are ternate (arranged with three leaflets), rounded to rounded triangular in shape with 4-to-20-millimetre (5⁄32-to-25⁄32-inch) long petioles.
The flowers are produced in clusters (umbels) with 2 to 8 flowers, but often appear singly. The inflorescence have 3 leaf-like bracts similar in appearance to the basal leaves but simple and greatly reduced in size, pinnatifid in shape. Flowers have no petals, but instead have 5-9 petal-like sepals that are white, blue-tinted white or yellow in color. The flowers usually have 40 to 80 stamens but can have up to 100.
After flowering, fruits are produced in rounded heads with 5–14-centimetre (2–5+1⁄2-inch) long pedicels. When the fruits, called achenes, are ripe they are ellipsoid to ovate in outline, flat in shape and 5 to 9 millimetres (3⁄16 to 11⁄32 in) long and 4–6 millimetres (5⁄32–1⁄4 in) wide. The achenes are winged with no hairs and have 0.8–1.5-millimetre (0.031–0.059-inch) long beaks that are curved or recurved.
