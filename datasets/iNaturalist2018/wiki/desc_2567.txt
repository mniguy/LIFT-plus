Sufflamen bursa, also known as the bursa, scythe or boomerang triggerfish, is a triggerfish from the Indo-Pacific. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a size of 25 cm in length. "Scythe" markings on the tail of the triggerfish contain pigments which may change hue from light yellow to dark brown depending on mood of the fish.
