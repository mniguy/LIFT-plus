Creatonotos transiens is a moth of the family Erebidae. The species was first described in Western literature by Francis Walker in 1855.


== Distribution ==
C. transiens is found in China (Shanxi, Shaanxi, central China, Tibet, Yunnan, Sichuan, Hong Kong, Hainan, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Fujian), Taiwan, Japan (Ryukyu), eastern Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Indochina, Borneo, Bali and Lombok.  Records attributed to the Philippines are likely referable to Creatonotos wilemani Rothschild, 1933, as Dubalotov & Holloway noted misplaced wilemani material in  The Natural History Museum, London, collections. Records attributed to Sulawesi are referable to Creatonotos kishidai Dubalotov & Holloway, 2007

== Ecology ==
Adults of C. transiens can be found in various secondary habitats. Males of several Creatonotos species, including C. transiens possess inflatable  coremata for dispersing pheromones prior to courtship of females; pheromone release and courtship take place within a couple of hours after sunset.The larvae feed on a wide range of plants, including Beta, Dioscorea, Paspalum, Zea, Pithecellobium, Vigna, Wisteria, Toona, Musa, Salix, Cayratia and Cissus species. The larvae are dark brown, with a very pale yellow dorsal stripe.
