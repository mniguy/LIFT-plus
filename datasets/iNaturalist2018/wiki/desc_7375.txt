Hoheria sexstylosa, the long-leaved lacebark or ribbonwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae, endemic to New Zealand. It is an evergreen tree or shrub growing to 8 m (26 ft) tall by 6 m (20 ft) broad with glossy green leaves, and white flowers in summer and autumn. This tree tends to have a weeping graceful habit and is sometimes sold by nurseries with the name graceful lacebark. The Latin term sexstylosa means "six styles".Distribution in the North Island is from Waikato and the Coromandel Peninsula south to Wellington, while in the South Island natural populations appear to be in North West Nelson, inland Marlborough and Banks Peninsula. Other populations may be naturalised.
In cultivation it is frost-hardy but requires a protected site. The cultivar 'Stardust' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
