Urosaurus is a genus of lizards, commonly known as tree lizards or brush lizards, belonging to the New World family Phrynosomatidae.


== Description ==
Species in the genus Urosaurus can be distinguished from members of the genus Sceloporus by the presence of a gular (under neck) fold and granular lateral scales.  They can be distinguished from members of the genus Uta by the presence of enlarged (sometimes only slightly) dorsal scales.


== Reproduction ==
Urosaurus have been used as a model system in lizard life-history studies, and populations produce two or more clutches of eggs per year. Field studies have also shown a cost of reproduction in a natural New Mexico population of the species Urosaurus ornatus.
