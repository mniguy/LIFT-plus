Stellagama stellio may attain a total length (including tail) of 35 cm (14 in) or slightly longer.


== Behaviour and habitat ==
Like many agamids, S. stellio can change its color to express its mood. It basks on stone walls, rocks, and trees. It is usually found in rocky habitats, and is quite shy, being very ready to dive into cracks to hide from potential predators.

There are several subspecies, and S. stellio is likely a species complex. More research will be done, and this species may yet be split into several species.The following seven subspecies, including the nominotypical subspecies, are recognized as being valid.

Stellagama stellio cypriaca (Daan, 1967)
Stellagama stellio daani (Beutler & Frör, 1980)
