The variegated lizardfish (Synodus variegatus) is a lizardfish of the family Synodontidae found in the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, at depths from 4 to 90 m. It can reach a maximum length of 40 cm.


== Description ==
The variegated lizardfish is rounded in cross-section with a broad, moderately flattened head and a large, wide mouth. The jaws protrude equally. Both jaws and all the mouth bones are covered with conical, barbed teeth. The strong, thick pelvic fins serve as props when the fish is resting on the bottom waiting for prey.
The variegated lizardfish varies in color from grey to red, with hourglass-shaped markings.


== Taxonomy ==
The species Synodus dermatogenys was once misidentified as S. variegatus, while the true S. variegatus was referred to as S. englemani Schultz, 1953 by many authors, including Gosline & Brock (1960) and Cressey (1981). However, Waples and Randall (1989) showed that S. variegatus is a senior synonym of S. englemani, and that S. dermatogenys is the correct name for the lizardfish that Cressey (1981) identified as S. variegatus.
