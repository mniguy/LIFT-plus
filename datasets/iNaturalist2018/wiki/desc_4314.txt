Hypsiglena jani, commonly known as the Texas night snake or the Chihuahuan night snake, is a small species of mildly venomous snake in the family  Colubridae.  The species is native to the southwestern United States and adjacent northeastern Mexico.


== Etymology ==
The epithet, jani, is in honor of Italian taxonomist Giorgio Jan.


== Description ==
H. jani grows from 10 to 16 inches (25 to 41 centimetres) in total length (including tail), record 20 inches (51 cm). It is typically a light gray or tan in color, with dark brown or dark gray blotching down the back, and has an unmarked underside. It has smooth dorsal scales. The eye has a vertically elliptical pupil. H. jani is rear-fanged, and is considered to be venomous, though it is not dangerous to humans.


== Behavior ==
As the common names imply, H. jani is a primarily nocturnal snake.


== Diet ==
The diet of H. jani consists of primarily lizards, but it will also eat smaller snakes and occasionally soft bodied insects.


== Habitat ==
H. jani prefers semi-arid habitats with rocky soils.


== Reproduction ==
H. jani is an oviparous species that breeds in the spring rainy season, laying 4-6 eggs that take approximately 8 weeks to incubate before hatching. The eggs average 27 mm (1.1 in) long by 10 mm (3⁄8 in) wide. The hatchlings are about 15 cm (5.9 in) in total length.


== Geographic range ==
H. jani ranges from southern Kansas to southern Colorado, and south throughout New Mexico, the western half of Texas to central Mexico.


== Subspecies ==
Three subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
