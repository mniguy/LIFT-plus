== Subspecies ==
Three subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
Senticolis triaspis intermedia (Boettger, 1883) – Arizona, New Mexico, northern Mexico
Senticolis triaspis mutabilis (Cope, 1885) – Central America
Senticolis triaspis triaspis (Cope, 1866) – southern MexicoNota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Senticolis.
