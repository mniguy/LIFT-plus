== Habitat and conservation ==
Dendropsophus microcephalus inhabits savanna and forest edge species, often in association with wetlands. It also occurs in disturbed or altered habitats at foothills and low elevations in secondary forests and pasture grasslands or cut-over forests. It can also be found in marshy areas outside or adjacent to forest, including temporarily open areas. Breeding takes place in temporary and permanent pools. It is nocturnal. It altitudinal range is 0–1,300 m (0–4,265 ft)  (to 1,800 m in Colombia) above sea level.
Dendropsophus microcephalus is a very abundant species throughout its range. There are no significant threats to this species that also occurs in many protected areas.
