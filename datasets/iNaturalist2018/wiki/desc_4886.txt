Alaria marginata, the winged kelp, is a brown alga species in the genus Alaria. It can grow up to 13 feet. Fronds are long and narrow with raised midrib and wavy edges. Each frond has two rows of several smooth, oblong, 5 inch spore-bearing blades at the base in winter. The base is attached to rocks.According to a study done by Widdowson(1971), the kelp Alaria marginata has been known to occupy certain wave-exposed intertidal habitats. These habitats can be found in the northeast Pacific from Alaska to near Point Conception, California. Alaria marginata has been the dominant macroalga on this exposed mid-to-low rocky shores along the Big Sur coast of California. In the kelp species Alaria marginata, phenolics act as chemical defence against herbivores.
