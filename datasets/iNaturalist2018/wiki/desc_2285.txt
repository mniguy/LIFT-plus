Aplodactylus is a genus of perciform fishes, the marblefishes, native to southern Australia, New Zealand, Peru, and Chile. They are also known as sea carps. This genus is the sole genus in the family Aplodactylidae. Marblefish are found in shallow reefs in Southern Australia, while not known by many anglers, the marblefish can put up a good fight when catching landbased. The largest marblefish ever caught landbased was 43 cm on January 16th, 2018.


== Etymology ==
The genus name, meaning 'simple finger' (Greek aploe + daktylos), refers to some rays of the pectoral fins having a simple form.  An emendation to Haplodactylus ('single finger', from Greek haploos) by Agassiz has been ruled as being unjustified.
