The Kurrichane thrush (Turdus libonyana) is a species of bird in the thrush family Turdidae. The species is found from central through to southern Africa. Its natural habitat is dry savanna and woodland, predominantly miombo woodland.


== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The Kurrichane thrush was described in 1836 by the zoologist Andrew Smith, based on a specimen collected in the Transvaal in South Africa. It was originally assigned to the defunct genus Merula. The species is a sister species to the Comoro thrush.The specific epithet of the Kurrichane thrush, libonyana, is derived from the Tswana name for the red-billed buffalo weaver, Lebonyana.  It was given by mistake to this species, possibly because it also has a reddish bill. Its common name is derived from a corruption of Kaditshwene (rendered as 'Kurrichane') in South Africa, where the original specimen was collected. That name is thought to be based on a Tswana expression, "Ga se ka ditshwene!", which means "What an incredible number of baboons".
