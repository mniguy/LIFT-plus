The Talamanca hummingbird (Eugenes spectabilis) or admirable hummingbird, is a large hummingbird.  Some taxonomic authorities, such as the International Ornithological Committee, split the magnificent hummingbird into two species, in which case the nominate subspecies fulgens is renamed Rivoli's hummingbird and spectabilis is named the admirable hummingbird. Other taxonomic authorities have not recognized the split. The talamanca hummingbird's range is Costa Rica to Panama.
