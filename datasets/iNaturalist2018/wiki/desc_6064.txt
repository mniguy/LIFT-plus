Raoulia is a genus of New Zealand plants in the pussy's-toes tribe within the daisy family.Raoulia grow in alpine areas, forming very fine and dense growths. These compact growths form large amorphous cushion-like masses with only the growing tips visible. Due to their shape and form, the plant clusters resemble sheep from afar, this giving them their alternate name, vegetable sheep.
