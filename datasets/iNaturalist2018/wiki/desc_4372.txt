The common collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), also commonly called eastern collared lizard, Oklahoma collared lizard, yellow-headed collared lizard, and collared lizard, is a North American species of lizard in the family Crotaphytidae. The common name "collared lizard" comes from the lizard's distinct coloration, which includes bands of black around the neck and shoulders that look like a collar. Males can be very colorful, with blue green bodies, yellow stripes on the tail and back, and yellow orange throats. There are five recognized subspecies.  


== Description ==
C. collaris can grow to 8–15 in (20–38 cm) in total length (including the tail), with a large head and powerful jaws. Males have a blue-green body with a light brown head. Females have a light brown head and body.


== Geographic range and habitat ==
C. collaris is chiefly found in dry, open regions of Mexico and the south-central United States including Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The full extent of its habitat in the United States ranges from the Ozark Mountains to Western Arizona. 


== Cultural Impact ==
The collared lizard is the state reptile of Oklahoma, where it is known as the mountain boomer. The origin of the name "mountain boomer" is  not clear, but it may be traceable to settlers traveling west during the Gold Rush. One theory is that settlers mistook the sound of wind in canyons for the call of an animal in an area where the collared lizard was abundant. In reality, collared lizards are silent.


== Behavior ==
Like many other lizards, including the frilled lizard and basilisk, the collared lizard can run on its hind legs, and is a relatively fast sprinter. Record speeds have been around 16 miles per hour (26 km/h), much slower than the world record for lizards (21.5 mph or 34.6 km/h) attained by the larger-bodied Costa Rican spiny-tailed iguana, Ctenosaura similis.
The collared lizard in the wild has been the subject of a number of studies of sexual selection. In captivity if two males are placed in the same cage they will fight to the death.


== Subspecies ==
Five subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
Crotaphytus collaris auriceps Fitch & W. Tanner, 1951
Crotaphytus collaris baileyi Stejneger, 1890
Crotaphytus collaris collaris (Say, 1823)
Crotaphytus collaris fuscus W. Ingram & W. Tanner, 1971
Crotaphytus collaris melanomaculatus Axtell & Webb, 1995Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Crotaphytus.


== Etymology ==
The subspecific name, baileyi, is in honor of American mammalogist Vernon Orlando Bailey.
