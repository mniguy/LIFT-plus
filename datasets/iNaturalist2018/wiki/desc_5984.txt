Pilosella horrida (synonym Hieracium horridum), known as the prickly hawkweed or shaggy hawkweed, gets its name from the long, dense, shaggy white to brown hairs (trichomes) which cover all of the plant parts of this plant species. The species is native to Oregon, California, and Nevada in the western United States.Pilosella horrida possesses oblong leaves along the stems of this 4 inches (10 cm) to 15 inches (38 cm) tall hairy plant with 11-12 bright yellow flower heads at the top of each flower head, which is 0.315 inches (8 mm) to 0.354 inches (9 mm) in diameter.  It flowers between late June and August.
Like all members of the family Asteraceae, the flowers are actually florets made up of many ray corolla, each ray its own stamen. As with other plants of the tribe Cichorieae, the stems and leaves produce a milky substance when broken.
