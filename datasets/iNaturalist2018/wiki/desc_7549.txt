Coptis trifolia (syn. Coptis groenlandica), the threeleaf goldthread or savoyane, is a perennial plant in the genus Coptis, a member of the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to North America and Asia across the subarctic region.It has at least one small, deeply three-lobed, evergreen leaf rising from the ground.
The sepals are white and are easily mistaken for petals.  The four to seven petals are yellow and club-like, and they are smaller than the stamens which are numerous and thread-like with delicate anthers.
The long golden-yellow underground stem gives the plant its name.  This portion of the plant was chewed by Native Americans, including Algonquian-speaking peoples and the Iroquois, to relieve canker sores, and is the source of another common name, canker-root. It has also been used to make tea used as an eyewash.
