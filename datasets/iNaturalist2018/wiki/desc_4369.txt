The plumed basilisk (Basiliscus plumifrons), also called commonly the green basilisk, the double crested basilisk, or the Jesus Christ lizard, is a species of lizard in the family Corytophanidae. The species is native to Central America.


== Geographic range ==
The natural distribution of B. plumifrons ranges from eastern Honduras, through Nicaragua and Costa Rica, to western Panama.


== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The Green basilisk's generic name Basiliscus is taken from the legendary reptilian creature of European mythology which could turn a man to stone by its gaze: the Basilisk. This name derives from the Greek basilískos (βασιλίσκος) meaning "little king". This generic name was given in Carl Linnaeus' 10th edition of Systema Naturae.For the origin of the nickname "Jesus Christ lizard", see § Behaviour.


== Description ==

The plumed basilisk is the largest basilisk species, with an average snout-to-vent length (SVL) of approximately 10 inches (25 cm). Including the tail, it can reach 3 feet (91 cm) in total length. Adults are brilliant green, with bright yellow eyes, and small bluish spots along the dorsal ridge. Males have three crests: one on the head, one on the back, and one on the tail, while females only have the head crest. Juveniles are less conspicuously colored, and lack the characteristic crests.


== Diet ==
The plumed basilisk is omnivorous and eats insects, spiders, small mammals (such as rodents), small birds, small nonvenomous snakes, smaller species of lizards, amphibians, small fish, crustaceans (such as freshwater shrimp and crayfish),  fruits, seeds, flowers and leaves.


== Predators ==
The predators of B. plumifrons include birds of prey, opossums, coati, and snakes.


== Reproduction ==
Sexually mature females of B. plumifrons lay five to fifteen eggs at a time in warm, damp sand or soil. The eggs hatch after eight to ten weeks, at which point the young emerge as fully independent lizards.


== Behaviour ==
Male plumed basilisks are territorial; a single male may keep a large group of females with whom he mates. Plumed basilisks do not tolerate much handling when kept in captivity.B. plumifrons is able to run short distances across water using both its feet and tail for support, an ability shared with other basilisks and the Malaysian sail-finned lizard, Hydrosaurus amboinensis. This has earned the plumed basilisk the nickname "Jesus Christ lizard". It is also an excellent swimmer and can stay underwater for up to an hour.
