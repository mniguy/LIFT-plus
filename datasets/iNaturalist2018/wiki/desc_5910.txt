Coreopsis palmata is a perennial herb reaching about 80 centimeters (32 inches) in height. The leaf blades are often lobed, but are not divided into leaflets as in some related species. The flower heads contain ray florets up to 2.5 centimeters long, or sometimes longer. They are yellow, and generally a paler shade of yellow than related native Coreopsis. The center of the head has many disc florets that bloom yellow and darken as they dry. The plants flower in summer and the herbage may age red in the fall. The native habitat of this species includes woods and prairie.
